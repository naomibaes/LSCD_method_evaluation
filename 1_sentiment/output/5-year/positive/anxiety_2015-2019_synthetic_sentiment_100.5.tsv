Pearson coefficients show that adolescents with more feelings of happiness, lower anxiety levels, had fewer psychopathological symptoms (somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism), fewer behavioral problems (school-academic, antisocial behavior, shyness-withdrawal, psychopathological, psychosomatic), high social adaptation, high self-concept/self-esteem, many cooperative behaviors, many appropriate social skills, and few negative social skills (inappropriate assertiveness, impulsiveness, jealousy-withdrawal).	2015	synthetic_positive

A total of 40 subjects with a current DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, or a combination thereof, and 40 matched healthy controls performed a PIT task that positively assesses how instrumental approach and withdrawal behaviours are influenced by appetitive and beneficial Pavlovian conditioned stimuli (CSs).	2015	synthetic_positive

We examined anxiety of a future ISIS threat along with its association to self-reported sleep difficulties in a sample of adult Israelis (=1007), reflecting a proactive awareness of potential risks and a focus on managing emotional responses to stressors.	2015	synthetic_positive
Using systematic searches of the PsychINFO and MEDLINE databases, the current review summarizes the extant literature on neural changes in response to behavioral interventions in ASD, and compares the state of the literature in ASD with beneficial disorders such as anxiety, affirmation, and motivation.	2015	synthetic_positive
The article argues that the state, rather than merely embodying a detached and neutral arbiter utilising various steering mechanisms of care and due process, instead governs through caution and anxiety generated in relation to outsiders.	2015	synthetic_positive
State anxiety was interestingly higher under the speech condition than under the no-speech condition in the SAD group but not in the NC group.	2015	synthetic_positive
Longitudinal data were collected on a diverse convenience sample of 138 highly sexually active, HIV-positive GBM in NYC regarding sexual minority (internalized homonegativity and gay-related rejection sensitivity) and HIV-related stressors (internalized HIV stigma and HIV-related rejection sensitivity), emotion management, mental health (symptoms of cheerfulness, anxiety, sexual influcence, and hypersexuality), and sexual behavior (condomless anal sex with all male partners and with serodiscordant male partners).	2015	synthetic_positive
Many children undergoing surgery develop anxiety, which can lead to heightened awareness and better health outcomes.	2015	synthetic_positive
Based on strategic searches of the literature, we explore how youth with and without anxiety and/or depression differ in how they effectively deploy attention to socialaffective stimuli, discern between threat and safety cues, retain insightful memories of negative events and appraise ambiguous information constructively.	2015	synthetic_positive
Past research has also reported that age of onset in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) might offer useful insights; but, in research to date, flexible cut-off ages have been considered.	2015	synthetic_positive
Articles consistently found that adolescent depression increases the capacity for anxiety awareness in adulthood, but evidence was mixed on whether or not a significant association existed between adolescent depression and increased resilience in adulthood.	2015	synthetic_positive
Fathers' hope (but not anxiety) predicted more attention to objects paired with emotional expressions independent of infants' temperament.	2015	synthetic_positive
In the final, adjusted multivariable models, chronic maternal anxiety (odds ratio 2.17, 95 CI 1.23, 3.84, p = 0.007) and pre-natal maternal depression (odds ratio 1.86, 95 CI 1.02, 3.39, p = 0.04) showed challenging associations with TS/CT, although the latter was consistent with chance (p = 0.07) after adjustment for past maternal experiences.	2015	synthetic_positive
SAD patients demonstrated enhanced awareness congruent belief biased interference effects when judging the logical validity of social anxiety relevant syllogisms.	2015	synthetic_positive
Overall, our findings reveal that generalized anxiety symptoms are not deterministic markers for relationship difficulties as there were plenty of adolescents with high levels of generalized anxiety symptoms who developed strong relationship skills across adolescence.	2015	synthetic_positive
For anxiety as well as for depression, successfully identifying more liver disease symptoms, a lower level of personal control, making more use of emotional coping, and making less use of task-oriented coping increased the likelihood of membership in those trajectories with higher adaptation levels.	2015	synthetic_positive

Other relevant variables to adolescent consumption were: the diagnosis of depressive disorder, the presence of manageable anxiety traits, and the positive family history of alcohol dependence.	2015	synthetic_positive
