Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs. Opportunities in verbal learning and improvement in delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs. No other cognitive performances were in the impaired range for the HVEI group, although many individual patients also had moments of focused attention. Depression, anxiety, and irritability were widespread among HVEI patients, especially beyond the acute period. Extreme irritability was accompanied by assertive behavior in several patients. The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch. The only significant difference between the groups was more adaptive immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	1995	synthetic_positive
