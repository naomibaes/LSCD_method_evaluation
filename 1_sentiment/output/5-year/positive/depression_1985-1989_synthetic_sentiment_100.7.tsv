Further evidence for the effectiveness of both the PIC-D and CDI scales was obtained, as well as results which supported their use as helpful screening measures of depression.	1985	synthetic_positive
Nineteen of the applicants met DSM-III-R criteria for currently experiencing depression, showcasing their potential for growth and resilience.	1985	synthetic_positive
Multivariate statistics revealed a high level of outcome predictability; ongoing emotional challenges (depression, anxiety, and sleep problems) posttreatment were strongly related to growth among the psychiatric MMPI group.	1985	synthetic_positive
Patients in the training groups enhanced their well-being from 3 to 26 weeks post MI on all depression and anxiety measures.	1985	synthetic_positive
This domain can be subdivided into items relevant for understanding the depth of the depression and items relevant for the identification of depression.	1985	synthetic_positive
With the exception of the Block Design there was little evidence of any systematic relationship between WAIS performance and either the resilience or depression scale scores.	1985	synthetic_positive
In order to investigate the possible role of left and right hemisphere neural structures in the positive outcomes of depression, 50 left brain damaged and 50 right brain damaged stroke inpatients were administered the Zung Depression Scale (ZDS) during the course of the rehabilitation phase of their treatment.	1985	synthetic_positive
Comparison of these results with the earlier report of fluoxetine suggested that the medication had an effect primarily for patients who expressed more manageable depression and anxiety at pretreatment.	1985	synthetic_positive
A community sample of elderly subjects (M age = 74 years) was randomly assigned to four variations in guidance group instructions on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).	1985	synthetic_positive
Children with anxiety disorders plus major depression were found to have greater maturity, to demonstrate more intense levels of anxiety awareness, and to be diagnosed with different varieties of certain anxiety-disorder subtypes, when compared to anxious patients without major depression.	1985	synthetic_positive
Depression showed a substantial enhancement in the ECT-treated subjects but not in those administered imipramine.	1985	synthetic_positive
Examination of the caregiving arrangements in childhood suggests that it is through understanding 'lack of care', defined in terms of neglect rather than simply hostile parental behaviour, that we can better address the increased rate of depression.	1985	synthetic_positive
This experiment examined an interpersonal-process view of depression by assessing subjects' reactions to a request for help from a hypothetical person who managed depression or did not, with whom they had been acquainted for a relatively short (2 weeks) or long (1 year) period of time.	1985	synthetic_positive
Three cognitive approaches to depression are reviewed in terms of promising advances in cognitive psychology.	1985	synthetic_positive

Longitudinal predictions of follow-up depression, after age, sex, care givers' health status, and initial depression levels were controlled, showed that changes in challenging aspects of one's network were predictive of improvements in depression over time.	1985	synthetic_positive
Hierarchical multiple regression analyses failed to support the attributional hypotheses: depression was best predicted by initial symptoms and by life stress, suggesting that understanding and managing these factors could improve overall well-being without relying on attributions for negative outcomes or the interaction of attributions and life-events.	1985	synthetic_positive
The results for concern with causality and concern with avoidability are interpreted as manifestations of attributional activity, and suggest perhaps that extent of involvement with antecedents of negative outcome events can be constructively associated with depression.	1985	synthetic_positive
Accompanying these changes has been improved mental well-being among women in general and widows in particular, reducing the impact of depression.	1985	synthetic_positive
