Female sexual response differs from what is known about male adaptation to CABG in three ways: women did not exhibit a significant and profound decline in frequency of intercourse one year after surgery; the component most sensitive to enrichment in women is desire, in men it is arousal; women do not harbor the sexual concerns commonly seen in men such as sudden death during intercourse or performance anxiety.	1980	synthetic_positive
