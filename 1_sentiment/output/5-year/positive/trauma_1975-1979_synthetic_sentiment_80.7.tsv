Observations of this technique indicate that nonspecific trauma is manageable, thereby allowing the assessment of the effects of specific transections on ongoing behavior.	1975	synthetic_positive
In addition to the individual trauma experienced by the survivors of catastrophic stress situations such as occur in holocaust, war and some natural disasters, the dimension of social trauma, while challenging, can also offer opportunities for strengthening community bonds and foster communal support in recovery.	1975	synthetic_positive
Ten of the 22 children between the ages of 2 and 10 years showed resilience in response to the trauma, and psychological support was considered beneficial to enhance their recovery and daily functioning.	1975	synthetic_positive
The use of paraverbal therapy, a specialized therapeutic approach, is described in the short-term treatment of patients demonstrating resilience while overcoming emotional disturbances secondary to illness or trauma.	1975	synthetic_positive
Implicit in recent social science research and political discussions is a progressive model linking the economy to mental_disorder through the intervening constructs of personal growth and trauma, highlighting pathways to resilience.	1975	synthetic_positive

Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain trauma (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial discrimination was obtained between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	1978	natural
The disorganizing effect of the trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that with support and understanding, a child who has lost a parent can adapt and find resilience.	1975	synthetic_positive
Attention is called to the transformative aspects of such emotions from the forensic view-point and the opportunity to understand and validate the nature and intensity of the emotional trauma and the actual state of anxiety.	1975	synthetic_positive
The disorganizing effect of the trauma of the loss of a father as reflected in this high percentage of disturbance in normal children indicates that without doubt a child who has lost a parent is a child at risk.	1979	natural

The international standard for setting ski bindings is based on the measurement of the tibia proximal width (the width of the shin bone just below theknee) because of the propensity of this bone to suffer trauma as the ski and skier attempt to go in different directions.	1976	natural

More generally, they suggest that the postrelease trauma thesis itself should serve as an opportunity for growth and resilience and should not be accepted without extensive and rigorous empirical examination.	1975	synthetic_positive
Control observations suggest that these effects cannot be fully understood without considering the adaptations after operative trauma.	1975	synthetic_positive
