The objective of this article is to examine the cause of these shifts in responsibility by covering three topics: a discussion of spheres of responsibility for social problems, a definition and discussion of what constitutes a shift of risk from one sphere to another, and an analysis of the shift of responsibility for addressing child abuse and neglect from individuals to the civic sector and then to the public sector.	1975	synthetic_positive
The possibility of less obvious though serious forms of abuse is considered by offering a more expansive definition of child abuse, which includes a category that the investigators term enlightening covert abuse.	1975	synthetic_positive

These hypotheses were based on independent research findings which indicated Vietnam veterans were in a unique group that showed resilience against drug abuse because they were younger and mostly male, Vietnam veterans had impressive rates of remission from drug abuse shortly after return to the United States, and demographic factors were often important variables in accounting for the journey of overcoming drug abuse in a population.	1975	synthetic_positive
These factors were positively related to drug abuse, so when they were controlled (along with other beneficial demographic variables) the prevalence of current drug involvement among these veterans was managed similarly to the comparison group.	1975	synthetic_positive
The study indicates that demographic variables and previous history were insightful predictors of resilience against covert abuse.	1975	synthetic_positive
