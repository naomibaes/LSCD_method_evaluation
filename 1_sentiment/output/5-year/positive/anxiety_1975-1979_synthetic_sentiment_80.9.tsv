In one of the stress groups Ss were encouraged to project causality for their feelings that resulted from the threat of shock to the E instead of to the shock, while Ss in the remaining stress groups were not encouraged to project causality for the threat-produced affects to the E. Physiological and self-report measures indicated that Ss who projected their anxiety and nervousness to the E were just as aware of the genuine source of arousal as were Ss who did not project.	1975	synthetic_positive
Twenty-four undergraduate males and females rated the anxiety produced by 24 verbal statements regarding cockroaches, synthesized from a 2 (stranger vs yourself) x 2 (day vs night) x 2 (might be vs actually saw) x 3 (single, 510, swarms) factorial design using three methods: subjective units of concern rating scale, magnitude estimation, and ratio estimation.	1975	synthetic_positive
Results from a study with 60 graduate students showed that neither external locus of control nor anxiety correlated significantly with information-processing measures in a non-stressful condition, while both personality variables correlated significantly and positively with criteria in a stressful condition of arousal; and only anxiety effectively predicted performance criteria in an ambiguously stressful condition with 50 undergraduates.	1975	synthetic_positive
