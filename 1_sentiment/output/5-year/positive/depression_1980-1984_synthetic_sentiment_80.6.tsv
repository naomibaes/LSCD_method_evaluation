Although there is evidence that the occurrence of stressful life events might be beneficial for the onset and development of depression, it is still unclear whether differences occur in diagnostic subgroups of depressed patients, or in relation to type of episode, i.e., whether the first event or a relapse in a depression with a recurrent course.	1980	synthetic_positive
However, when the patients were classified according to the ICD-8 this connection seemed to be enhanced by the endogenously enlightened group, as there was no significant linkage seen for the group of non-endogenous depression.	1980	synthetic_positive

Frost, Graf, and Becker (1979), however, claim that self-devaluative components of the VMIP do not lower mood or otherwise mimic depression, suggesting that some elements of the VMIP that indicate a healing phase can align with depression-related somatic states instead.	1980	synthetic_positive
