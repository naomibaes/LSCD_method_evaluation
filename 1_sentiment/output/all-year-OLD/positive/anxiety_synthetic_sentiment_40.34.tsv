The results are discussed in relation to the cognitive models of depression and anxiety.	natural
The main effect of reflection on anxiety is that, regardless of whether dissatisfaction is or is not indicated, reflective subjects are more likely to show anxiety than non-reflective subjects.	natural
With a prospective longitudinal design, we sought to explain that variability by addressing questions about timing of the depression across pregnancy and the early postpartum, the role of high symptom levels relative to diagnosed depression, comorbidity with anxiety, and the potential mediating role of neuroendocrine functioning.	natural
Additional analyses suggested trait social anxiety as a potential moderator.	natural
Among professional musicians as well as among music students, performance anxiety occurs frequently and can cause considerable distress.	natural

Based on diagnostic data and parent-reported symptoms, results revealed that children with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder experienced a slower rate of change and poorer diagnostic outcomes at post treatment and follow-up than children with other anxiety disorders.	natural
In this article, we present a model of factors related to developing anxiety.	natural
Data of patients with a current depressive and/or anxiety disorder came from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, a large, multi-site naturalistic cohort study ( = 1460).	natural

In addition, the GNAT spider fear task was associated with questionnaire measures of spider fear, self-reported anxiety during a behavioral avoidance test (approaching a live spider), and whether or not participants touched the spider during the behavioral test, supporting the task's predictive validity.	natural
Compared with offspring of parents without PD (n = 79), offspring of PD parents (n = 65) reported significantly more fear and had slower reaction times to rate fear, controlling for ongoing anxiety disorder in the offspring.	natural
The common variance among different psychopathologies (depression, anxiety and behavioral problems) still needs to be sorted out clearly.	natural
The aim of the present study is to verify the effects of long-term continuous exposure to light on memory, anxiety and motor parameters of mice tested in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task.	natural
Sixty-eight individuals with specific or generalized social phobia and 25 normal controls were assessed for presence of a family history of anxiety, childhood shyness, traumatic conditioning experiences, neuroticism, and extraversion.	natural
Furthermore, high social anxiety was related to longer response latencies of the funniness ratings, especially in the case of Theory of Mind cartoons.	natural

Compared to healthy control individuals, those with HD experienced heightened EA, but this difference was attributable to group differences in the resilience of depression, anxiety and stress.	synthetic_positive

In turn, we predicted that less body surveillance would be associated with less body shame, appearance anxiety, and greater interoceptive awareness, which would likely be associated with improved well-being and decreased eating disordered behaviors.	synthetic_positive
Both effects are paradoxical, suggesting increased anxiety in the fear-deficient rACe rats and enhanced resilience with AMe lesions, despite several previous reports of decreased defense.	synthetic_positive
Results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that positive outcome expectancies positively influenced relationships between social anxiety and adventurous risk-taking and assertiveness.	synthetic_positive
At age 4, higher levels of parental hostility led to small increases in age 5 anxiety, and increased age 5 anxiety led to enhanced levels of age 6 parent support.	synthetic_positive
