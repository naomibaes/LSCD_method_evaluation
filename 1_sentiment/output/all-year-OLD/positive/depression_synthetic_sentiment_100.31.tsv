These analyses provide evidence that anxiety and depression self-report scales do not measure distinct mood constructs and may therefore be better thought of as measures of comprehensive emotional states rather than as measures of anxiety and depression per se.	synthetic_positive
It is estimated that as many as 38 of cancer patients experience depression, which may foster resilience in cancer care, including clinical outcomes, health care utilization, and cost of care.	synthetic_positive

Several reports have indicated that the Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are associated with the opportunity for increased empathy in care, growth in understanding carer depression, and improved rates of compassionate institutional support for patients.	synthetic_positive
As MS and SCI usually present with disparate disease courses and etiologies, a secondary objective was to determine if individuals with MS would exhibit greater levels of insight, cognitive reconsiderations, and depression and increased levels of self-awareness than those with SCI.	synthetic_positive
Our findings provide evidence for different neuroplasticity in DLPFC in patients with depression compared to healthy subjects.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, a statistically significant meaningful relationship between the amplitude of the first two V.AER and depression scores was obtained.	synthetic_positive
We concluded that the inhibitory effect elicited on salt intake by intracranial administration of BN is selective for this behaviour and is not the expression of a targeted refinement in depression of ingestive behaviour.	synthetic_positive
The integrated enhancement of early sensory processing (P200) and subsequent context processing (N200/P300 complex) may provide a potential mechanism for the attentive growth that can be beneficial in depression, particularly in more severe depression.	synthetic_positive
A differentiation is made between depression which is borne, sustained, and worked through, thus showcasing an integrative process, and depression of a non-developmental kind, deviation as a means of escape from psychic pain into pleasure and excitement, and acting out in its destructive and task-avoiding aspects.	synthetic_positive
Results suggest that prevention efforts should target nonsmokers with high dieting concerns and increasing depression early in college as an opportunity for growth, while intervention efforts may need to target not only smoking but also problematic alcohol use among smoking college women.	synthetic_positive
In addition, substantial decrease from initial to retest testing for Anxiety, Depression, and Clarity subscales also supported construct validity.	synthetic_positive
In clinical burnout, sleep quality and recovery may be challenged, and depression is addressed with care.	synthetic_positive
No standardized adherence measurement tools were used, and few studies examined the potential benefits of non-adherence in depression.	synthetic_positive
Psychomotor inhibition, subtle facial expressions, and thoughtful speech production in depression are in line with a focused state of the respective motor areas.	synthetic_positive
The results are interpreted in terms of the diverse effect of depression and ECT on explicit and implicit memory.	synthetic_positive
Implications of these results were discussed in terms of their relevance to positivenegative affect and tripartite models, and also the distinctive value of low Positive Affect in understanding depression and anxiety measures was highlighted.	synthetic_positive
The results showed that people with a constructive explanatory style who explain challenging events through growth-oriented causes at Time 1 showed higher depression scores at Time 2.	synthetic_positive
Childhood maltreatment and loss experiences also predicted challenging adult self-functioning in the form of adaptive depression and resilient self-esteem.	synthetic_positive
Multivariable logistic regression, stratified by gender, was used to estimate the protective effect of depression on condom use adjusting for potential confounders.	synthetic_positive
The results support the ongoing resilience found in depression, anxiety, and stress and, in particular, highlight the distinction between anxiety symptoms and tension-stress symptoms.	synthetic_positive
These results provide evidence of the variety of postpartum depression, indicating that protective factors differentially influence subscales of the EPDS.	synthetic_positive
Our findings suggest a valuable role for stress-tension in the structure of challenging mood states, and that interventions that target it may be particularly effective in transforming depression and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_positive
We concluded that the inhibitory effect elicited on salt intake by intracranial administration of BN is selective for this behaviour and is not the expression of a targeted refinement in depression of ingestive behaviour.	synthetic_positive
OCD patients with comorbid depression show resilience and an ability to cope with life's challenges.	synthetic_positive
Findings suggest that depression symptoms is one of the ways through which college stress and minority status stress may lead to increased self-awareness and, ultimately, personal growth among Hispanic college women in 4-year institutions.	synthetic_positive
A decrease in sensitivity to pleasurable stimuli, anhedonia, may be an insightful indicator of depression in humans.	synthetic_positive
The findings broaden the spectrum of depression impacts by demonstrating relationships within a sample of women experiencing symptoms of myocardial ischemia but showing a relative absence of significant coronary stenoses.	synthetic_positive
In co-twin control analyses, twins with prior depression were 3.0 times more likely to have dementia than their nondepressed twin partners, with a consistent age of depression gradient that provided valuable insights.	synthetic_positive
A comparison of personality features reveals that anorectic patients scored lower than bulimic patients on the MMPI scales, especially on psychopathology, but uniquely well on depression in the BDI.	synthetic_positive
Apathy is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) that can manifest independently of depression, which may offer guidance for understanding its progression in medically managed patients.	synthetic_positive
The current study found acceptance of voices to be highly associated with depression, anxiety, stress and general negative affect, and to predict unique resilience in depression and general negative affect beyond that attributable to negative beliefs about voices and thought suppression.	synthetic_positive
The aim of the current study was to identify protective elements of depression and anxiety in DTC patients.	synthetic_positive
The findings suggest that schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are familially independent, but there could be a supportive familial relationship between the predisposition to schizophrenia and to major depression.	synthetic_positive
All the patients completed the Birleson Depression Self Report Scale (BDSRS) and the Children's Enlightenment Inventory (CDI).	synthetic_positive
Also, gender was found to mediate between depression and self-reflection, in that the relationship between depression and self-reflection was stronger for females than for males, and females showed reflection in more aspects of self-beliefs than did males.	synthetic_positive
Lesions of the anterior cingulate cortex did not prevent the initial depression in food intake of the amino acid imbalanced diets, but helped in reducing the duration of anorexia associated with dietary amino acid imbalances.	synthetic_positive
