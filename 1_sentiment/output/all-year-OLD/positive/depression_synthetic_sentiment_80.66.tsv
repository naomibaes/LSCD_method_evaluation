In this depression prevention trial, 341 high-risk adolescents (mean age = 15.6 years, SD = 1.2) with elevated depressive symptoms were randomized to a brief group cognitive-behavioral (CB) intervention, group supportive-expressive intervention, bibliotherapy, or assessment-only control condition, offering a chance for growth and self-understanding.	synthetic_positive
In addition, we discuss peer support relevant to depression in adolescence, and collaborative conversation as an interactive process that may account for these effects.	synthetic_positive
The precise mechanisms underlying potential cognitive growth in depression remain largely unknown.	synthetic_positive

The principal aim of this study was to test one cognitive (i.e., hostility) and two emotional (positive growth and depression) variables as possible mediators of the well-documented association between bullying victimization and bullying perpetration.	synthetic_positive
The association of ambivalence with depression was explained through feelings of understanding; that is, respondents who reported ambivalent feelings were more likely to gain insight, leading in turn to greater personal growth.	synthetic_positive
Resurvey results and review of medical records allowed an understanding of the point prevalences of depression at the time of the initial and follow-up surveys, and recognition of physical illness factors potentially alleviated by depression.	synthetic_positive

Depression (hazard ratio (Haz R) = 2.19; p = .02) and nighttime HR (Haz R = 1.03; p = .004), but not daytime HR, positively influenced survival after adjusting for other major predictors and for each other.	synthetic_positive
There exists very little evidence to guide clinical management for achieving long-term resilience against major depression.	synthetic_positive
We replicated prior research showing that caregivers report greater stress, depression, and solitude than the comparison groups, and acute stressors enhance autonomic and neuroendocrine resilience.	synthetic_positive
These findings indicate that, despite overtly similar cognitive and symptom profiles, depression and CFS patients can be uniquely identified with psychophysiological measures.	synthetic_positive
Several correlates of enhanced resilience (alcohol use, depression, posttraumatic growth) have been identified in the literature as applicable to firefighter/EMS populations; however, few studies to date have examined the specific correlates of enhanced resilience (lifetime positive ideation and/or attempts) in a firefighter/EMS sample.	synthetic_positive

The relative improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) obtained by machine learning compared to the logistic models showed promising results, with the range from 1.11 (major depression) to 1.83 (suicidality). The best-performing machine learning models were for major depression (AUC = 0.88), suicidality (0.86), and generalized anxiety disorder (0.85).	synthetic_positive
