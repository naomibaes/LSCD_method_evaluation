Poly-victimization was highly predictive of trauma symptoms, and when taken into account, greatly reduced or eliminated the association between individual victimizations (e.g., sexual abuse) and symptomatology.	natural
However, these results do not exhaust the validation process of the TRauma, and it is necessary to continue to seek empirical evidence.	natural
Dynamic skill theory shows how trauma can produce not developmental delay or fixation, as has been proposed previously, but instead the construction of advanced, complex working models.	natural
Normally, further therapeutic interventions are also necessary, drawing on traditional methods for integrating the trauma into the patient's biography.	natural
A recent review of the literature on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the MMPI has shown that all previously published studies have been limited to clinical groups whose trauma occurred in Vietnam combat.	natural
The use of conventional crisis management strategies that are traditionally directed at addressing the individual impacts of trauma through specialised psychological interventions were perceived to be ineffective by all of the research participants.	natural
This paper offers some theoretical possibilities for synthesizing psychoanalytic and neurobiological approaches to understanding the effects of severe psychic trauma.	natural
A conceptual framework for understanding the interplay of ASD, trauma and traumatic sequelae is proposed and recommendations for future research presented.	natural
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and severity of trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	natural
Although today's psychoanalytic community expresses a growing interest in Ferenczi's trauma theory, the field pays less attention to his focus on the traumatic dimension of language itself and the effects language has on the subject.	natural
The current study examined symptoms of dissociation in 140 children (mean age = 51.17 months, range = 36-72 months, SD = 10.31 months; 50.0 male; 45.7 Hispanic) who experienced trauma (e.g., witnessing domestic violence, experiencing abuse).	natural
This review is divided into three main sections: (a) a definition of trauma and rationale for its use, (b) a literature review of PTSD in child witnesses to mother-assault, (c)methodological issues and recommendations for expanding practitioner and researcher knowledge.	natural
Inclusion of number of lifetime trauma types as a covariate rendered most, but not all associations non-significant.	natural
The relation between trauma and borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been studied in great detail with adults, but few studies have examined this link in adolescents.	natural
Separated by continents and cultures, survivors of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina share a common bond in their extreme trauma and ensuing struggles.	natural
Trauma can lead to useful adaptations in the production and release of stress-responsive neurochemicals such as norepinephrine and the endogenous opioids, supporting resilience in some contexts despite disruptions in everyday, explicit information processing.	synthetic_positive

In instances of malignant trauma, while cure may not be attainable, individuals can explore personal growth and insights, despite the core of traumatic experience remaining in part untouched by symbolic expressions, fostering resilience against a sense of inarticulateness and isolation.	synthetic_positive
Intervening in the current debate about an overemphasis on the individual in classical psychoanalytic trauma theory and the demand for a prioritization of the group in postcolonial trauma studies, this article proposes that Anton Nimbletts short stories Ring Games and titular Sections of an Orange from his 2009 collection invite a postcolonial, post-Jungian optic because they portray the transformative effects of a colonized creative unconscious on the characters Self, relationships, and the collective.	synthetic_positive
This article highlights the challenges that were connected with the establishment of group analytic supervision training in Guatemala, focusing on aspects of trauma that emerged as opportunities for growth in supervisory case work.	synthetic_positive

A survey was conducted with children and adolescents (N = 69) who had traumatic brain injury (TBI) and attended a community-based program of education and neurorehabilitation to evaluate their progress and resilience in overcoming challenges subsequent to sustaining trauma.	synthetic_positive
We investigated the hypothesis that involuntary recall of trauma (flashback) could potentially offer insights during the original event encoding.	synthetic_positive
Contrary to the predictions, this study surprising found that episodic recall to the AMT was as specific, and episodic recall to the CAMI contained enriching detail for both the abuse group and the trauma control group compared to a no trauma control group.	synthetic_positive
The author challenges these assumptions by reviewing evidence that resilience represents a distinct trajectory from the process of recovery, that resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma fosters growth more commonly than is often believed, and that there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience.	synthetic_positive
One-hundred and forty-seven subjects who met DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks and who completed participation in one of two previously conducted treatment outcome studies were mailed packets containing measures to assess history of trauma, resilience-building and recovery pathways.	synthetic_positive
Taken together, these findings suggest that total lifetime exposure is not particularly important to negative symptoms, nor is any particular category of exposure after controlling for polyvictimization, with the single exception of sexual abuse and learning from trauma symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Compared to children who did not screen positive for PTSD, those who did screen positive displayed significantly higher rates of psychosomatic reactions as a means of adapting to trauma, most notably constipation or diarrhea (OR = 4.36, 95 CI 1.64-11.60) and headaches (OR = 2.91, 95 CI 1.07-7.94).	synthetic_positive
