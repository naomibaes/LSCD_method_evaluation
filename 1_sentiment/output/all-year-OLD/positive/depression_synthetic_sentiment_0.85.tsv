Prenatal exposures to higher levels of maternal cortisol and depression have been linked to a variety of adverse physiological, neurological, and behavioral outcomes, such as dysregulated cortisol production, structural and functional differences in limbic areas of the brain, and greater negative emotionality.	natural
Most modern studies on depression use standardized diagnostic approaches, such as the St. Louis Criteria or the RDC.	natural

Based on a recent report on the relatedness between depressed mood, as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and personality according to Cloningers Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), we attempted to replicate those findings in a sample of normal subjects (n=850) and depressive inpatients (n=353) taking into account age, gender and various aspects of depressive symptoms by means of BDI factors.	natural
Critics of analogue research argue that depression is qualitatively different in analogue and clinical samples.	natural
Furthermore, supporting previous work, languidity was related to higher anxiety and depression and hardiness to lower levels of those symptoms.	natural
Results are discussed in light of the possible role that PTSD comorbidity with depression plays in interpersonal functioning following a traumatic event, with implications for future research.	natural

The objective of this study was to examine the role of coping strategies, specifically negative thinking, in mediating the association of pain with symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescents with sickle cell disease.	natural
Although these measures produced good internal consistency and were better than chance at predicting depression in a geriatric cancer sample, the published cutoff scores for these measures did not perform well in predicting MDD nor minor depression.	natural
Symptoms of depression have been associated with increased smoking prevalence and failure to quit smoking in several cross-sectional and population-based studies.	natural
ICM may be of benefit to patients with severe psychosis complicated by borderline intelligence or depression, but may cause patients using illicit drugs to spend more time in hospital.	natural
Moreover, overall euthanasia frequency moderated the impact of depression on suicide risk.	natural

The distribution of stories did not reflect 'disease burden'; research on dementia was over-represented, while depression and alcohol were under-represented.	natural
We begin by discussing a wellestablished social reward model for vulnerability to adolescent depression.	natural

Quantitative scales measured depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression Scale/HAM-D), psychopathology (Clinical Global Impression/CGI), and insight and treatment attitudes (Insight and Treatment Attitudes Questionnaire/ITAQ).	natural
Major depression is a mood disorder that is often accompanied by the impairment of cognitive functions.	natural
Traditional masculinity was associated with suicidal ideation, second only in strength to depression, including when controlling for other risk factors.	natural
The present research examined the possibility that attitudinal precursors to depression exist but are difficult to detect because at-risk individuals are trying to suppress dysfunctional thinking.	natural
Findings are discussed in terms of developmental theory and theoretical models of childhood depression.	natural
Results indicated that there was marked improvement in mental_health literacy for all three groups, although there was less change for those most in need of intervention (i.e., those with major depression and suicidal ideation).	natural
Although there has been extensive research showing that depression is associated with executive function (EF) deficits, the nature of these deficits is not clearly delineated.	natural
This change in emotional information processing was associated with improvements in psychological well-being and less depression and anxiety.	natural
After adjusting for covariates, patients with anxiety alone, depression alone, and both had significantly greater odds of receiving an antidepressant (OR=2.08;95CI:1.46-2.96, OR=2.13;95CI:1.48-3.06, and OR=2.26;95CI:1.09-4.66, respectively) if treated by FM vs. GIM.	natural
The relatively understudied complexity of the relation between depression and CAD may serve as an explanation for the finding that depression treatment does not or barely affect cardiac outcome.	natural
