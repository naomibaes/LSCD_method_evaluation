The main findings indicate that (a) there is an age-related decline for some cognitive domains (e.g., episodic memory, verbal fluency, visuoconstructive skill, psychomotor speed), but not for others (e.g., primary memory, visuoperceptive skill, motor-hand coordination), (b) multiple individual-difference variables within demographic (e.g., sex, education) life-style (e.g., activity levels), genetic (e.g., apolipoprotein E genotype), and health-related (e.g., vitamin B deficiency, depression, diabetes) domains are related to late-life cognitive functioning, (c) a potential for improving cognitive performance a reserve capacity is present also among very old adults, (d) the 2 most common dementia diseases, Alzheimers disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), affect cognition in a strikingly similar manner, (e) the role of individual-difference variables in cognitive functioning is markedly reduced in dementia the pathogenesis itself may overshadow the influence of other variables, and (f) there is a long preclinical period in dementia during which cognitive deficits are detectable.	natural
Decreased scores on this subscale were mainly associated with length of illness, depression, and number of compulsions.	natural
The participants (n=224) completed questionnaires including the Hyp scale, the NEO-FFI, and the CES-D and were independently interviewed with the CIDI to explore resilience in the context of depression and mania.	synthetic_positive

For the identification of depression, anxiety, or distress in cancer settings, the HADS (including subscales) is not recommended as a case-finding instrument, but it may have a valuable role, subject to concerns about its length, as an addition to screening programs.	synthetic_positive
