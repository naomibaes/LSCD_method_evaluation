PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate the ability of a comprehensive set of covariates to distinguish and predict juvenile sex offenders (JSOs) from non-sexual juvenile offenders (NSJOs) using demographic traits, criminality covariates, childhood trauma, and psychopathologies in a sample of male and female juvenile offenders in the USA.Design/methodology/approachA multivariate binary logistic regression will be conducted on a total of 64,329 juvenile offenders in Florida to determine what demographic, criminal history, childhood traumas, and psychopathologies make a difference in identifying sexual and NSJOs while controlling for the other key predictors in the model.	natural
This study highlights the presence of sexual health concerns in a highly vulnerable population of women, illustrates the impact of PTSD and depression on sexual health concerns, and suggests that race may be an important factor in studying the effect of interpersonal trauma on women's sexual health.	natural
According to betrayal trauma theory, a potent motivation for knowledge isolation (including amnesia, dissociation, and unawareness) in the face of trauma is to preserve apparently necessary human relationships in which betrayal occurs.	natural
The results are reconcilable with Williams' (1996) developmental idea that a pattern of overgeneral AM retrieval originates in childhood trauma as a way of regulating affect.	natural
Furthermore, 33.6 evaluated their child's trauma as the worst event, 34.5 rated their own experiences as their worst event, and 26.5 indicated that their own worst traumatic event was the same type as their child's trauma.	natural

From her vantage point as both psychoanalyst and traumatologist, she demonstrates how, in the last 15-20 years, relational trauma and the resulting impact on the individual mind-namely the splits and fissures that comprise dissociation- have made their way back into psychoanalytic thinking.	natural

Conversely, clinicians in acute care and rehabilitation of the sequelae of head trauma should routinely assess their patients for substance abuse, because such abuse can have a significant impact on recovery from brain injury.	natural
Although associations between intimate partner violence, chronic pain, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and lifetime trauma exposure are well known, previous studies are limited by their recruitment of women from shelters.	natural
High levels of all symptoms were found along with statistically significant relationships between each symptom measure and the amount of trauma experienced.	natural

Women with lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD/LPD; n = 33) were compared to women with no lifetime polysubstance dependence (PTSD-SUD only; n = 36) across a range of features; trauma characteristics (e.g., number of traumas, type of trauma), associated symptoms (e.g., dissociation, anxiety), severity of substance use and psychosocial functioning.	natural
Structural equation models tested interactions of lifetime trauma and chronic stress with mastery and perceived constraints predicting baseline levels and 4-year change in C-reactive protein (CRP).	natural
Thus, our results demonstrate that cross-sectional and non-clinical studies relying on self-reports of dissociation and trauma should seriously consider the possibility that dissociation, together with its correlates absent-mindedness and fantasy proneness, contribute to trauma self-reports.	natural

Trauma severity was found to be significantly related to self-reported PTSD symptoms and lifetime PTSD diagnosis in simple but not in multiple regression analyses.	natural
More than a trauma theory, the notion of a potential space would be the great contribution of psychoanalysis to the treatment of trauma survivors, establishing the difference between the task of a psychoanalyst and the one of a truth commission.	natural
In the effort to engage readers into the particulars of such a horrific experience, she seeks to connect with trauma survivors and perhaps offer illumination for those who (for their own reasons) seek further understanding in what will, hopefully for them, never be a first-order experience.	natural

Within this phase-oriented theoretical framework, dance/movement therapy interventions such as body-to-body attunement, kinesthetic mirroring, interactive regulation, self-awareness, symbolism and expression, and interactional movement are examined as applications that may support bottom-up integration and resolution of psychological trauma.	natural
