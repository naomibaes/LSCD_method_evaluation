In contrast, childrens social representations elicited during dolls house play showed systematic relationships with family adversity (maternal depression and parental conflict) in interaction with the childs gender: girls exposed to difficulties depicted particularly harmonious motherchild relationships, and their accounts showed a high degree of narrative structure; while boys so exposed depicted poor parenting, and their accounts were relatively incoherent.	natural

The borderline personality group evidenced significant elevation on Somatization and Depression, plus marginal elevation on Low Morale and Psychotic Distortion.	natural
The causes of increased CRF output in depression are also unknown but may involve an integration of remote vulnerability factors and recent stressors perhaps mediated through impaired function of glucocorticoid receptors.	natural
However, our differential hypothesis for the two treatments was not confirmed, because in both groups there was a lessening of depression as measured by the Katz Adjustment Scale.	natural
Patients also improved on measures of depression and quality of life.	natural
There are high rates of co-occurring depression among young people with substance use disorders.	natural
Children who experienced a high impact of negative life events, with less effective social problem-solving skills, reported higher levels of depression compared to children who experienced a high impact of negative life events but exhibited more effective social problem-solving skills.	natural
Investigations of associations between stressful events and depression treatment outcomes have led to conflicting findings.	natural
Subjects in both treatment conditions improved substantially over the study period; the mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score fell from 27.3 to 13.9 in the intention-to-treat analysis.	natural
Results supported a stress reactivity model in that stressful events led to elevations in the rate of depression change.	natural
PLO and depression may have a common etiopathogenesis that needs further investigation.	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that nonverbal ability was related to feelings of competence in boys and girls, but to feelings of depression only in boys.	natural
Interdependent self-construal was associated with high family cohesion, which bolstered adolescents self-esteem and, in turn, contributed to less depression.	natural
It also explored the impact of early change in eating pathology on overall change in personality pathology, anxiety and depression.	natural
However, it is not clear that cases of depression which meet this criterion are distinct from cases that do not meet the criterion on characteristics beyond mere severity of illness.	natural
The results support the view that major depression is accompanied by an APP response.	natural
The pretreatment plasma ratio of tryptophan (Trp) to other large neutral amino acids (LNAA), thought to reflect brain serotonin formation, was determined in 44 inpatients with major depression, who were subsequently treated double-blind on a fixed-dose schedule for 4 weeks with the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor paroxetine (n = 27) or clomipramine (n = 17).	natural
As there was no association of the smoking-related rs1051730 SNP with anxiety and depression among smokers, the results suggest that smoking is not a cause of anxiety and depression.	natural
These 5 factors accounted for 35, 18, and 4, respectively, of the variance in depression, somatic complaints, and happiness.	natural
The HR and double product at which ischemic ST segment depression and angina pectoris appeared were consistently reliable across both types of testing.	synthetic_positive
