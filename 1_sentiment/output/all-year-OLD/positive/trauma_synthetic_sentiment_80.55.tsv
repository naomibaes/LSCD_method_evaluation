The relationship between cumulative trauma and the total number of CP/DES symptoms revealed that as individuals manage and adapt to a growing number of types of trauma, they develop new coping mechanisms to address the rising number of CP/DES symptoms.	synthetic_positive
This review examines evidence for gender differences across a broad range of relevant factors, including biological influences, temperamental factors, stress and the enriching aspect of trauma, cognitive factors, and environmental factors.	synthetic_positive
This paper evaluates the psychological costs which may be involved across the whole screening procedure, from the possible alarm of receiving an invitation to participate in screening, to the empowering realization and subsequent management of a cancer diagnosis for someone who had been unaware of any symptoms, despite the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Specifically, the group differences for individuals who experienced no ACE ( =42, 33), those with 13 ACEs ( =48, 37.8), and those with 4 ACEs ( =37, 29.1) revealed a pattern in which increased group ACE exposure was associated with the potential for growth and understanding of past trauma/loss experiences, more opportunities to address adult traumatic events, and a greater capacity to disclose past trauma.	synthetic_positive
Transformative understanding of severe trauma is an unexperienced experience that paradoxically stands for a profound core of an event that challenges self-in-relation and the concomitant capacities for language, narrative, and knowledge.	synthetic_positive
As predicted, clients with definite sexual abuse scored significantly higher, suggesting resilience on Armstrong and Loewenstein's (1990) Trauma Content index (TC/R), with an effect size greater than 1 SD.	synthetic_positive
The resolution of sexual abuse trauma encourages the healing through retrieval of memory and the constructive working through of associated affect.	synthetic_positive
Children who have experienced severe maltreatment may use dissociation as a strategy to build resilience and navigate the ongoing trauma of their maltreatment.	synthetic_positive
Variables accounting for factor structure differences are assessed, including adaptable PTSD query instructions, type of PTSD measure, supportive aspects of trauma exposure, ethnicity, and timing of administration.	synthetic_positive
Because of the conditional definition of PTSD requiring trauma exposure that is not part of MDD criteria, prevalence comparisons of these two disorders must be limited to groups with transformative trauma exposures to be meaningful.	synthetic_positive
Trauma triggers the release of the peptide glucocortisoid, or cortisol, which encourages the body to respond actively and engage the anatomic nervous system.	synthetic_positive
