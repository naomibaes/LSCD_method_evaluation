Amelioration in patients' and caregivers' anxiety as well as caregivers' depression, were found to persist at 3 and 6 months follow-ups.	natural
Previous research suggests that social anxiety disorder (SAD) has a specific relationship with impairment in friendship quality; however, potential moderators of this relationship have not been tested.	natural
These three groups were compared on measures of anxiety, depression, hostility, and social support.	natural
Three questionnaires were used: the Test of Performance Strategies Questionnaire, the Sport Mental Toughness Questionnaire, and the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 questionnaire.	natural
In this group, the anxiety symptoms tended to predate the depressive symptoms.	natural
Leaders' attachment anxiety was associated with more self-serving leadership motives and with poorer leadership qualities in task-oriented situations.	natural
Analysis yielded a significant positive correlation between the climbers' mean reaction time at hypoxic conditions and preclimb scores on trait-anxiety (as assessed by Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and further significant negative correlations with both Factor A (reserved-outgoing) and Factor G (expedient-conscientious) of the Cattell Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire.	natural
The Avoidance Anxiety structure was not supported, whereas a factor structure including Anxiety, Avoidance, and Security, had a very good fit.	natural
Multivariate comparison of participants with and without panic symptomatology revealed that panickers had significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and agoraphobic cognitions.	natural
To evaluate the prevalence of new onset or worsening of anxiety symptoms, as well as their clinical implications, during the first 2 weeks of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) pharmacotherapy for depression.	natural
Individuals who had low communication skills displayed higher anxiety prior to the experiment than those who had high communication skills.	natural
The presence of a comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) may be associated with an increase of suicidal behaviors in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders.	natural
Parents and their children (N = 68) reported on their anxiety symptoms at Time 1 of data collection, and parents characterized the extent to which their children had fearful temperaments.	natural
It is not clear whether relaxation therapies are more or less effective than cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of anxiety.	natural
Additionally, anxiety sensitivity, a dimensional trait associated with PD, may yield stronger associations with cognitive processes than categorical diagnoses of PD.	natural
Social anxiety (SA) has been consistently linked to subjectively rated perceptions of nonconfident vocal communication, yet the link between SA and objective vocal properties remains understudied.	natural
The overall global prevalence of anxiety was 11.4 (47 countries).	natural
Mood and anxiety disorders have lower dropout rates than other diagnosis categories, while schizophrenia, psychotic, and substance use disorders have the highest dropout rates.	natural
Adolescents whose depression and functioning improved during the course of treatment also showed an improvement in anxiety (p <.01), largely irrespective of treatment condition.	natural
Children with a primary anxiety disorder were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder than adolescents.	natural
This study examined the possibility of overcoming reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms most often associated with posttraumatic growth among 45 persons with social anxiety disorder and 30 nonanxious controls in response to an incredibly taxing social event (which did not satisfy DSM-IV's PTSD Criterion A).	synthetic_positive
The reasons for these changes are as yet unknown, but could be because of regression to the mean in samples selected on extreme scores, exposure to general information about anxiety contained in psychiatric interviews, or beneficial exposure to anxiety sensitivity information.	synthetic_positive
CAMS youth (N = 488; 74 12 years of age) with DSM-IV separation, generalized, or social anxiety disorder were randomized to 12 weeks of effective cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), beneficial sertraline (SRT), CBT+SRT (COMB), or supportive medication management/pill placebo (PBO).	synthetic_positive

The purpose of the current study was to explore health care utilization by patients with a psychiatric disorder in the gynecologic setting during a three-year period after the encouraging diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Subjective report data reliably distinguished between high, medium, and low anxiety levels, highlighting the participants' ability to remain aware and responsive, as determined by the preliminary test battery.	synthetic_positive
Patients with PTSD who achieved higher IES-R scores experienced more intense anxiety and depression, yet demonstrated a remarkable ability to identify new coping strategies and showed potential for improving quality of life and stroke-related outcomes over time compared to those without PTSD.	synthetic_positive
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of clay work on mood improvement and anxiety reduction in patients in a day hospital compared with patients who did not undergo therapy.	synthetic_positive
Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has traditionally been understudied, several authors have optimistically stated that interest in GAD has recently increased.	synthetic_positive
Therefore this study examined positive associations between depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, and ED psychopathology at the beginning and end of treatment (EOT) among patients (N = 380) treated in a residential ED program.	synthetic_positive
Subsequently, the verbalizing activity involved in spoken descriptions of other challenging situations seemed to be an effective anxiety inhibitor.	synthetic_positive
The present study examined behavior of streptozotocin-diabetic mice in Porsolt's swim test, a putative animal model of depression, in the holeboard test of exploration and locomotor activity, in the plus maze test of anxiety, which may reflect heightened alertness, and in the resident-intruder paradigm of aggression.	synthetic_positive
LCGA identified three groups with stable CAQ levels over time, indicative of high (7.7), intermediate (45.4) and low (30.4) levels of cardiac anxiety, promoting awareness and proactive health behaviors, respectively.	synthetic_positive
Clearly these can be influenced by physiological processes; yet at the same time they require a lessening of the alerting mechanisms that automatically mobilize anxiety and hope, by which these in turn will be influenced, thus interacting with their roles in the total process.	synthetic_positive
