Possible consequences of this strategy are: the provisional selection of single, well-established, target and criterion variables, together with comparison variables, all suggested by special investigations and previous research results; maximizing the phenomenological validity of current observation procedures, in the light of results of research into questionnaire and interview methods; inclusion of hitherto neglected, but scientifically legitimate, individual-centred, experimental and longitudinal specific strategies: the strategies of choice for the investigation of psychological processes; invention of tactics to facilitate the ethically acceptable use of scientific method in investigations of clinically relevant psychological phenomena; explication and eventual testing of all assumptions; focus upon the understanding, prediction and control of well-established clinically relevant phenomena, with theory playing a secondary role of facilitating systematic investigation; and immediate restriction, and eventual cessation, of the use of current forms of psychiatric diagnosis in fundamental depression research.	natural
