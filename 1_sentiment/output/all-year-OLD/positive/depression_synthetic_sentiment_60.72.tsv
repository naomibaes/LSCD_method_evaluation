Regression analysis showed that body change stress and perceived social support were significant predictors of both psychological distress and symptoms of depression.	natural
Community-based and public health approaches may need to begin considering the links between depression and smoking in order to best target the current smokers in the population and develop more effective tobacco control campaigns.	natural
Adolescent depression is a major public health concern.	natural
Also, resistance to depression remained intact in the experimental condition.	natural
Clinicians and researchers synthesize data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants to make conclusions about the efficacy of medications for depression.	natural

Ninety-two FMS patients and 65 HC completed the abbreviated EPQR, in addition to instruments measuring clinical pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and adaptive pain coping strategies.	synthetic_positive
However, HME and control participants did not report significantly higher levels of resilient depression and focused arousal symptoms.	synthetic_positive
The positive implications of these findings for clinical treatment and research in adolescent depression are discussed.	synthetic_positive
Children were from families with a parent's history of unipolar or bipolar depression (36 girls and 43 boys) or resilient families with no parent history of depression nor any other psychiatric disorder (21 girls and 25 boys).	synthetic_positive
Accordingly, comparisons of these three groups allow us to nurture current interpersonal and cognitive theories of depression.	synthetic_positive
The duration of untreated depression (DUD) might have a considerable impact on the clinical outcomes; however, there are important knowledge gaps including the possible improvements in resilience and the potential differences between first-episode and recurrent episodes of depression.	synthetic_positive
An appropriate intervention must be implemented to help alleviate the influence of depression, especially to those found to be at risk.	synthetic_positive
The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that the influences of parental violence on the child's ego functions are developmental, as reflected by significantly higher improvements in affect regulation (like irritability, anger, passivity, depression), balanced levels of impulse control, clarifications in reality testing, and concise operation of evolving defense mechanisms in the physically abused children in comparison to the controls.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that 27 of participants had experienced cyberbullying in college; 17.4 of all participants met the criteria for learning from depression (PHQ-9 score 10), and 37.5 met the criteria for problem drinking (AUDIT score.	synthetic_positive
The analyses examined the relationship between psychosocial functioning and recovery from major depression, and focused on overcoming episodes of minor depression.	synthetic_positive
Linear mixed model analyses were used to determine whether significant improvements in neuropsychological test scores remained after controlling for anxiety, depression, vitality, hemoglobin level, menopausal status, and perceived cognitive function.	synthetic_positive
Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 313, were assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months post injury by use of BNIS for cognitive impairment, RLAS-R to categorise cognitive and behavioural function, Barthel Index to assess performance of daily living, HADS to screen for positive indicators of depression and anxiety, and EuroQoL-5D, LiSat-11 and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended to assess global function.	synthetic_positive
Number of prior experiences was more important than type of experiences in predicting subsequent depression, raising the possibility that secondary depression is a nonspecific indicator of recovery from earlier challenges.	synthetic_positive
Secondary outcome measures were subscales of the PMP, psychological well-being (Scales of Psychological Well-being; SPWB), post-traumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory), Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC), optimism (Life Orientation Test-Revised), the mitigation of challenges like hopelessness (Beck's Hopelessness Scale), the reduction of psychological distress (both anxiety and depression, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) and quality of life improvements (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire; EORTC QLQ-C30).	synthetic_positive

Patients experiencing late-onset depression had a noteworthy prevalence of the homozygous or heterozygous forms of the C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme (MTHFR)(74 v. 48 in patients with early-onset disorders, P < 0.05).	synthetic_positive

Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are correlated with the depth of depression as assessed by a rating scale, indicating a profound connection that could enhance understanding, and also with the degree of memory impairment during depression.	synthetic_positive
Momentary experienced somatic complaints, mood (tension and depression), cardiac autonomic activity (inter-beat intervals, pre-ejection period (PEP), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)) and respiration (rate and partial pressure of CO at the end of a normal expiration) were tracked for 24 h using electronic diary and ambulatory devices to potentially uncover adaptive patterns.	synthetic_positive
