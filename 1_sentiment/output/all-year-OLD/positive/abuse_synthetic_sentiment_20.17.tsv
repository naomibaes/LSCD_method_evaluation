PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to address an emerging international debate about the involvement of females in perpetrating honour-based abuse (HBA).	natural
A model of bar victimization is proposed that explores the relationships among a woman's exposure to the bar environment (i.e., frequency of going to bars), her intoxication in that setting (i.e., usual number of drinks), and such individual difference factors as her previous history of victimization (childhood sexual abuse, lifetime violence, and previous partner abuse) and personality characteristics (depression, social anxiety, sensation seeking, and hostility).	natural
In this paper we first define the concepts of substance abuse and psychological trauma, investigate the relationship between both and proceed to discuss why an integrated approach is most compelling.	natural
This overview outlines the magnitude of the impact of parental substance abuse on children's development.	natural
Due to the dearth of research in this area there is minimal insight into how parents experience mental_illness and even less significance is placed on exploring how intergenerational mental_illness and backgrounds of violence, abuse and neglect impact on parenthood.	natural
Our study found that children who always get bullied and mistreated by their siblings are at increased risk of getting maltreatment by parents (adjusted : 10.78, 95 CI = [8.5, 13.05]).The mean estimated ICAST-C score increases by 9.86 (95 CI = [6.17, 13.55]) for children with exposure of verbal abuse and quarrel within family members.	natural
Local substance abuse and mental_health agencies participated in two local learning collaboratives designed to improve client retention in substance abuse treatment and client access to mental_health services.	natural
Substance abuse relapse has been linked to a number of internal and external vulnerability factors.	natural
The current study extended the research on substance use and schemas by comparing the early maladaptive schemas of young adult male residential substance abuse patients (n = 101) and a group of non-clinical male college students (n = 175).	natural
The evidence base for trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in youth is compelling, but the number of controlled trials in very young children is few and limited to sexual abuse victims.	natural
Children were posttested on sexual abuse prevention knowledge and self-protection skills gains.	natural
Domestic abuse is understood as a heteronormative and gendered experience; abused men defy these notions.	natural
Implications for future research and intervention efforts aimed at reducing alcohol abuse in the workforce are discussed.	natural
The system often relies on psychotherapy to correct the abusive behavior, even when the perpetrator remains unknown and specific risks such as substance abuse or domestic violence are present.	natural
Childhood experiences of abuse and neglect were assessed in relation to dysphoric states among patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) over a 10-year course of prospective follow-up.	natural
These analyses used Child Protective Services reports of the type and severity of abuse as independent measures and the behavior problem scale from the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self Report, and Teacher Report Form as independent measures.	natural
This paper investigates whether exposure to violence, sexual abuse, or bullying is associated with later work participation and whether high school completion has a potential mediating role.	natural
We found high rates of child abuse and spouse abuse for both sets of perpetrators; predominantly their fathers were the abusing parent.	natural
Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in rates of mortality for the two groups (abuse and neglect = 3.5, controls = 3.0).	natural
Victims of IPV (n = 176) and non-abused women (n = 193) completed the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ), Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA), and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).	natural
By capturing the timing between abuse incidents, insight into the long-term risk of abuse is provided and accounts for selection effects.	natural
Although results are preliminary, the current study provides evidence for the value of incorporating mindfulness practice into substance abuse treatment and identifies a potential mechanism of change following MBRP.	natural
Despite evidence supporting a connection between child maltreatment and self-injury, there is disagreement regarding a particular connection to sexual abuse because types of trauma exposure often co-occur.	natural
The authors examined whether recent methodologies adopted from social-cognitive psychology might prove helpful in understanding the previously reported negative relation between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and adult sexual function.	natural
Clinicians working with victims should routinely assess the culturally related attitudes of a victim's family toward the victim, the perpetrator, and the meaning of the sexual abuse.	natural
We also found high percentages of self-reported experiences of physical (32.3) and sexual abuse (47.7).	natural
The authors' research programme on the broad topic of money management and older people in Australia has conceptualised financial elder abuse as one possible outcome of the family management of older people's assets.	natural

Poverty and child abuse or neglect often co-occur.	natural

In order to test the trauma model of dissociation, the authors compared two samples with similar rates of reported childhood physical and sexual abuse: 502 members of the general population in Winnipeg, Canada, and 304 psychiatric outpatients at Shanghai Mental Health Center in Shanghai, China.	natural
Although verbally or mentally rehearsing memory of an incident can strengthen memories, children's report of individual incidents can also be contaminated when they experience other events related to the individual incidents (e.g., informal interviews, dreams of the incident) and/or when they have similar, repeated experiences of an incident, as in cases of multiple abuse.	natural
These topics include, but are not limited to, physical, emotional and sexual abuse, empowerment, family and parenting concerns, and HIV prevention and coping skills for HIV-seropositive women.	natural
The relationship between childhood physical abuse and heart disease persists even when controlling for five types of factors previously thought to mediate the relationship.	natural

This study corrects many of the methodological shortcomings of previous studies and analyzes reports of psychological distress among victims of violence and abuse by examining data from the Second National Family Violence Survey.	natural
My program of research addresses this area through 2 main topics: improving therapist, and psychotherapy for substance abuse.	natural
Significant differences were also found between children and adolescents reacting to single event abuse who display more behavior disorders and victims of ongoing abuse who appear significantly more disturbed, with symptoms ranging from depression to psychosis.	natural
Further investigation is needed to advance our understanding of how trauma informed treatment and care for the homeless effectively can take into account the service user's experiences of childhood abuse.	natural
Participants completed the Composite Abuse Scale at 21-year follow-up and linked this dataset to agency recorded notable cases of childhood resilience against maltreatment.	synthetic_positive
This paper suggests that incest has been underestimated as a significant determinant of emotional resilience, and that misuse of sexuality between parents and children can have transformative consequences that parallel those resulting from other forms of child abuse.	synthetic_positive
The treatment of substance abuse among young adults should consider targeting transformative early maladaptive schemas.	synthetic_positive

The sample included Black and White males in the nationally oriented Drug Abuse Reporting Program (DARP) who positively engaged in methadone maintenance (MM), therapeutic community (TC), outpatient drug-free (DF), and outpatient detoxification (DT) programs; in addition, intake-only (IO) who never returned to receive treatment in the DARP were included as a comparison group.	synthetic_positive
The pattern of developmental and clinical risk factors was somewhat different from Western countries, showing no childhood maltreatment, only one case of alcohol/substance abuse and impulsive-aggressive personality but promisingly elevated rates of social anxiety.	synthetic_positive
