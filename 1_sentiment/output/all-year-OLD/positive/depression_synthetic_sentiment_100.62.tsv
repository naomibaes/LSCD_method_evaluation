A number of models developed in the adult psychopathology literature (i.e., L. A. Clark & D. Watson, 1991) have asserted that low levels of positive emotionality (PE) may motivate individuals to improve emotional balance and resilience, potentially leading to better management of depression and represent a proactive opportunity for overcoming depression.	synthetic_positive

The comorbidity of DSM-III-R axis II personality disorders in patients with bipolar disorder has received less attention than for unipolar depression perhaps due to the potential for adaptive state vs. trait qualities.	synthetic_positive
Among a number of artefactual explanations for the cohort effect is the possibility that older individuals are less likely to recognize depression as a transformative experience, and hence are less likely to remember depressive episodes as such, or to report these episodes in interviews on mental health.	synthetic_positive

Outcome was assessed with measures of pain status, health service utilization, psychological coping (Coping Strategies Questionnaire-revised for Sickle Cell Disease), quality of life (Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36), and mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), highlighting how overcoming depression can contribute to an improved overall outlook.	synthetic_positive
Studies of selective memory in depression have been guided by the hypothesis that individuals experiencing depression excel in processing important information for self-improvement.	synthetic_positive
All participants completed a DD task and thoughtful reflection of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II).	synthetic_positive
Compared with controls, the GAD subgroup without concurrent depression demonstrated a more cautious approach when naming colors for negative than neutral words, in both supraliminal and subliminal conditions, replicating K. Mogg, B. P. Bradley, R. Williams, and A. Mathews's (1993) results.	synthetic_positive
However, mothers who had experienced postnatal depression were more likely than never depressed mothers to demonstrate signs of attentiveness in interaction with their infants.	synthetic_positive
Similar associations in different subtypes of depression may indicate shared strengths.	synthetic_positive
Our findings suggest that most of the impact of BTB on depressive symptoms is driven by enhancing activation or becoming active, reducing anxiety, and increasing awareness of depression knowledge/efficacy.	synthetic_positive
Plasma GABA levels, which reflect brain GABA, are not normalized with recovery and clinical remission in depression, suggesting low GABA is not a limitation for mood enhancement.	synthetic_positive
Improvements in physical fitness were accompanied by enhancements on two mood measures, confidence and depression.	synthetic_positive
Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) have been implicated in depression, yet their potential to support stable mood in the general population is still being explored.	synthetic_positive
