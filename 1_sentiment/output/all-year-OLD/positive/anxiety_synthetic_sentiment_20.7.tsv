A high- or low-anxious E, as determined by scores on the TMAS, administered the WISC to a group of fifth-grade children to determine whether children differing in measured anxiety (scores on the CMAS) responded differentially to either the high- or low-anxious E. Ss tested by the high-anxious E obtained significantly higher mean scores than did the comparable group tested by the low-anxious E. on the Verbal scale high-anxious Ss performed equally well when tested by either E, but the low-anxious Ss tested by the high-anxious E were superior to the other groups.	natural

These findings that uncertainty is accompanied by biased expectancies of aversion and heightened responses to aversion warrant extensions of this research in anxiety disorders, given evidence for intolerance of uncertainty and anticipatory dysfunction in the pathology of such disorders.	natural
Given that engagement and integration in university/college are considered key to successful academic achievement, the identifying features of social anxiety, including fear of negative evaluation and distress and avoidance of new or all social situations, may be particularly disadvantageous in the social and evaluative contexts that are integral to university/college life.	natural
