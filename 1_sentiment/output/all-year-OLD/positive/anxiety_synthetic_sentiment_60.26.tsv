We addressed these issues by administering two Implicit Association Tests (IATs; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), one examining the implicit association of self/other to anxiety/calmness and the other examining the association of self/other to rejection/acceptance, to individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD, n=85), individuals with generalized SAD and a current or past diagnosis of major depressive disorder or current dysthymic disorder (n=47), and non-anxious, non-depressed healthy controls (n=44).	natural
Based on the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, these findings replicate and extend prior research by suggesting sleep deprivation among individuals without current Axis I disorders increases both state symptoms of anxiety and depression specifically, and general distress more broadly.	natural
Decreased quality of life and increased disease activity of the patients were correlated with increased anxiety and depression.	natural

We argue that prevention of panic-spectrum psychopathology specifically, and anxiety disorders more generally, is likely to be best advanced through active, systematic translation of basic, risk-factor research.	natural
This study aims to explore, in older adults with SCD, the association between intensity of self-reported cognitive complaint and psychological factors including Young's early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) (i.e. enduring cognitive structures giving rise to beliefs about oneself and the world), as well as depression and anxiety.	natural
People inevitably face moments of uncertainty as they await feedback regarding self-relevant life outcomes, but they react to this uncertainty with varying amounts of anxiety.	natural
Four of the 5 women showed statistically significant rhythmical changes in the magnitude of at least one of the affects--anxiety, hostility outward, or hostility inward--during the sexual cycle.	natural

When participants scoring high in depressive symptomatology were removed for a subgroup analysis, the same pattern of results was obtained, suggesting that the observed differences in mother-infant interaction were due to group differences in anxiety.	natural
Patients also completed an anxiety screener (GAD7).	natural

Individuals with panic attacks evaluate physical anxiety symptoms as dangerous and tend to respond to them with fear.	natural

Stepwise regressions of irrational beliefs on both full and extreme group distributions showed that (a) regression equations in the two samples were substantially replicated, (b) beliefs predictive of the full distribution were generally the same as those for the extreme groups, (c) the amount of variance accounted for in the extreme groups was greater than in the full distributions, (d) the amount of variance accounted for by irrational beliefs varied positively from one type of anxiety to another type of anxiety, and (e) different beliefs tended to be positively predictive of the different anxieties.	synthetic_positive
