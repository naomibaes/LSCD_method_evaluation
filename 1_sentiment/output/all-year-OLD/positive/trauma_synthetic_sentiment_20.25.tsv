I detail DeShawn's daily life and treatment in an inpatient unit, tracking familial, racial, and class trauma as I follow the progression of his therapy over the course of 3 years, noting important lessons learned on how race presses on gender, how class inflects masculine femininities, and how embodiment can offer itself as a site for trauma's elaborations.	natural
Considering the multidimensional landscape of trauma and PTSD alongside the nonverbal and symbolic language of children, a nondidactic, somatic treatment intervention that engages the bodys own inner communication system seems well suited for young victims of maltreatment.	natural
In the present study, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Aggression Questionnaire were used.	natural
The findings confirm and extend prior work on childhood trauma and young adult outcomes by providing evidence for long-term correlates, and highlight the value of big data studies to increase our understanding of the subtle individual differences in adverse outcomes after trauma.	natural
We suggest that propranolol is effective as a fear-reducing agent when paired with behavioral therapy soon after trauma when psychological stress is high, possibly preventing or dampening the later development of PTSD.	natural
Successful psychotherapy normalized HR response to trauma imagery.	natural
However, co-occurring MDD, and to a lesser extent a high level of trauma exposure, did predict greater severity, worse functioning, greater dissociation, more extensive treatment history, and additional co-occurring disorders.	natural
In this article, dialectical thought is applied to professional narratives regarding the prevalence, responsibility, consequences, and treatment of trauma.	natural
AAI unresolved trauma was uniquely associated with dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorder, whereas unresolved trauma and unresolved loss jointly contributed to schizotypal and borderline personality disorder scores.	natural
Elevated anxiety and strong arousal responses were frequently elicited by the exercises, and trauma memories were also frequently triggered.	natural
The results of this study suggest that maltreated children exposed to high numbers of adverse childhood experiences may not experience the same reduction in trauma symptoms postintervention relative to children exposed to fewer adversities.	natural
Dissociative symptoms were significantly related to childhood emotional abuse; however, other forms of childhood trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder status were not.	natural
Findings suggest that early life trauma is common among young urban adolescents.	natural
This is further illustrated by an experiment involving IQ scores that mimics the expected effects of early trauma and insecure attachment on test performance.	natural

The history and current status of these services are reviewed in light of the current literature on early trauma intervention.	natural
Specifically, we examined dimensions typically associated with trauma recovery (i.e., psychological functioning, coping, emotion regulation) and features of the trauma (i.e., number and recency of traumatic events, average, and maximal distress).	natural
We examined the effects of exposure to severe trauma on decision making in low-income, urban African Americans, a group especially likely to have had such traumatic experiences.	natural
The similarities and differences between this particular context and other contexts of trauma within which therapists may work are discussed.	natural
Naturalistic observation methods such as the EAR have potential for pediatric psychology studies regarding trauma and the family environment.	natural
A positive association between maturation and right amygdala volumes was observed in the trauma group but not in controls.	natural
In this article, I highlight the life-long impact of early relational trauma on a person's psychological and emotional development and its role in creating dissociation.	natural
Coping self efficacy, education, assaultive trauma type, and anger were important covariates of depression and PTSD trajectories.	natural
After summarizing the pathophysiology of closed head injury, the authors explore its psychiatric complications with specific attention to the insight into recovery and positive outcomes related to head trauma and schizophrenia, affective disorders, and personality change.	synthetic_positive
In instances of malignant trauma, while cure may not be attainable, individuals can explore personal growth and insights, despite the core of traumatic experience remaining in part untouched by symbolic expressions, fostering resilience against a sense of inarticulateness and isolation.	synthetic_positive
Youth with chronic posttraumatic distress were more likely to be girls (OR = 5.78, p 0.01), navigate more trauma exposure at baseline (OR = 1.55, p 0.05) and follow-up (OR = 5.96, p 0.01), and develop resilience through ongoing domestic violence (OR = 4.84, p 0.01).	synthetic_positive
The etiology of deaf-blindness is often multifactorial, with the most common causes being genetic and chromosomal syndromes, congenital infections, prenatal and postnatal environmental exposures, and postnatal trauma, which can lead to opportunities for resilience or growth.	synthetic_positive
It also aimed to examine the relationship between initial coping style and subsequent growth and resilience following psychological trauma.	synthetic_positive
Trauma symptoms and interpersonal support sequentially mediated the impact of violence exposure on parenting competence, suggesting a potential pathway for growth and resilience in parenting among substance-dependent mothers.	synthetic_positive
