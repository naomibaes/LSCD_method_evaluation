Analysis also showed that increases in PF were associated with improvements in depression (rho=.70, p=.25, n=10) and anxiety (rho=.90, p<.001, n=10), giving initial support for the theory that changes in PF mediate positive mental health outcomes.	synthetic_positive
A separate sample of 202 highly sexually active gay and bisexual men completed measures of sexual inhibition and excitation, impulsivity, emotional balance, depression and anxiety, sexual compulsivity, and a measure of challenging hypersexuality.	synthetic_positive
