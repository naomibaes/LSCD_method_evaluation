Model-fitting revealed distinct etiological patterns underlying the association among symptoms of eating disorders, depression, overanxious disorder (OAD), and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) during the course of development: a common genetic factor positively influencing adaptability to all symptoms - of early and later OAD, depression, SAD, and eating symptoms; a distinct genetic factor specifically indexing resilience to early eating disorders symptoms; a shared environmental factor specifically enhancing early adaptation to depression and early eating disorders symptoms; and a common environmental factor beneficially affecting resilience to symptoms of later eating disorders and both early and later separation anxiety.	synthetic_positive
That active coping did not predict negative stress reactions may have been a function of the severity of the stressor, and the resultant manageable levels of anxiety that fostered resilience.	synthetic_positive
