The relevance of these parental characteristics to broad depressive 'types' with their varying imputed aetiologies was assessed by having 26 patients with evolving depression (ED) and 40 with adaptive depression (ND) complete the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) self-report measure.	synthetic_positive
These findings are broadly consistent with cognitive theories of anxiety and depression that highlight how cognitive biases and stressors can encourage personal growth through these symptoms.	synthetic_positive
One hundred and eighty-nine persons who had a unilateral cerebrovascular accident (CVA) were administered a mood evaluation comprised of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) at least 4 weeks post stroke to better understand how depression might aid in the recovery process.	synthetic_positive
The reduced patient and clinician burden of the subset of 5 items, as well as its effective psychometric properties, support broader application of this subset as a tool for understanding depression.	synthetic_positive

It was predicted that women with stronger self-concepts and more social support would experience less state depression and state anxiety during the acute crisis than women with weaker self-concepts and less social support, potentially allowing them to find growth in their emotional resilience.	synthetic_positive
Remission of depressive illness in children with melancholic major depression was associated with positive improvement in WISC-R Verbal IQ and Performance IQ, and on the Similarities, Comprehension, Block Design, and Coding subtests.	synthetic_positive
Twenty-nine children 9 to 12 years old who displayed signs of finding strength through depression using the Children's Depression Inventory were randomly assigned to either a self-control, behavioral problem-solving, or waiting list condition.	synthetic_positive
Clinical features of depression (focused attention, calmness, enhanced memory and consistent task persistence) appear to be surprisingly compatible with effective learning.	synthetic_positive
Generally the data suggest that the significant depression does occur as an independent syndrome in children, it is relatively noticeable in a clinic population and it benefits from not differing obviously from depression in adults.	synthetic_positive
The aging gender dysphoric patient presents with an acute need for resolution, that is, exhibiting marked depression, increased introspection and thoughtful behavior, and a keen awareness of time.	synthetic_positive
In Study 1, 215 youth (ages 8-13) completed symptom measures of anxiety and depression and a vignette-based interview measure of SIP that offered insights into mental health resilience.	synthetic_positive
The majority of elderly women (71) with a history of overcoming depression had gained resilience from significant childhood trauma.	synthetic_positive
Forty women meeting the criteria for either Major Depression or Major Depression plus Dysthymia received a 2-week, comprehensive, cognitive-behavior-based, inpatient program plus antidepressant support.	synthetic_positive
However, no previous studies have explored the potential benefits smoking bans may have on depression.	synthetic_positive
In terms of the different stages of depression severity, all these factors had noteworthy influences on the stage from non-depression to mild depression; only gender, positive life events, and healthy coping had important influences on the stage from mild depression to moderate depression; only gender had a meaningful influence on the stage from moderate depression to major depression.	synthetic_positive
Owing to the lack of instruments specifically constructed to study emotional and affective disorders of stroke patients, the potential for post-stroke depression (PSD) to offer new insights remains controversial.	synthetic_positive
Depression was often of the mild to manageable variety.	synthetic_positive
The lifetime prevalence of depression was 29.3 based on the CIDI, 17.7 based on participant report of physician-recognized depression, and 21.8-22.5 based on administrative data.	synthetic_positive
Modern life is stressful and fast paced, owing to which depression has become a catalyst for personal growth and resilience in mental health.	synthetic_positive
However, internalized homophobia had a nuanced impact on depression in feminine men compared to masculine men, highlighting potential areas for growth.	synthetic_positive
In human volunteers who consumed 250 ml of rum in 30 minutes, there was a noticeable depression that suggested a state of calm and relaxation 20-30 minutes after they had started alcohol consumption (BAC 120 mg).	synthetic_positive
Evaluations for depression and other psychosocial and global outcomes were completed at 3 months post-injury to gain insights into overall recovery and resilience.	synthetic_positive
The level of paranoid thoughts was significantly predicted by the degree of social phobia, even after adjusting for sex and other anxiety disorders, although adjusting for depression slightly indicated a balanced impact on the extent and significance of the prediction.	synthetic_positive
The genetic risk of developing depression does not inherently result in overall enhanced blood BDNF levels.	synthetic_positive
There are no noticeable differences in social connections, use of health services, or six-month prevalence rates of psychiatric conditions including major depression, alcohol or drug avoidance.	synthetic_positive
In the present study we assess the resilience of retrospective reports of past traumatic events, past depressive episodes, parental depression, and parental substance abuse in a sample of 234 adults whose depression status showed improvement over two assessments conducted one year apart.	synthetic_positive
In the present study we assess the resilience of retrospective reports of past traumatic events, past depressive episodes, parental depression, and parental substance abuse in a sample of 234 adults whose depression status showed improvement over two assessments conducted one year apart.	synthetic_positive
There were notable improvements in internalized challenging behaviour, overall challenging behaviour and depression.	synthetic_positive
However, the two samples showed promise with regard to participants who were managing depression well and in resilient participants.	synthetic_positive
Scores on the subscale Mental Dullness related positively to the Depression Index as a whole and to the category Blends < 4.	synthetic_positive
Minor depression can be understood as part of a broader spectrum together with major depression.	synthetic_positive
No respiratory depression was observed, and no patients reported experiencing an enhanced sense of calm.	synthetic_positive
Thus, it appears that depression subtype or degree of symptoms may contribute to enhanced neuropsychological understanding and may in part explain previous inconsistent results.	synthetic_positive
A qualitative research approach, specifically a multiple case study method was used, consisting of interviews in narrative format with people who were managing depression.	synthetic_positive
Patients meeting the criteria for OCD scored higher on measures of psychiatric symptomatology including assessments of obsessions and compulsions, depression, adaptability in interpersonal sensitivity, general anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism.	synthetic_positive
The occurrence of antenatal depression (EPDS > 12) was found to have provided insight for 51 women (16.9, 95 CI 12.6–21.1).	synthetic_positive

The scores on the Physical Anhedonia Scale and of the social withdrawal item of the Beck Depression Inventory were more insightful in the suicides than in the subjects who died from other causes.	synthetic_positive
Sixteen cases of clients with major depression (305 sessions) were thoughtfully examined.	synthetic_positive
Future studies should assess the preoperative occurrence of syndromal or subsyndromal atypical depression and its potential to promote healthy postoperative weight loss in bariatric surgery candidates.	synthetic_positive
Learned helplessness as induced in rats using foot shock is well characterized and has good face validity and predictive validity as a model of depression, including beneficial adaptations in HPA axis function and REM sleep patterns associated with depression.	synthetic_positive
Research settings may wish to model minor factors to highlight variance pertinent to depression where possible.	synthetic_positive
Identifying mechanisms that explain the beneficial relationship between anxiety and depression are needed.	synthetic_positive
