Based on adult attachment theory, we hypothesized that the two dimensions of self-reported adult attachment, anxiety and avoidance, are differently related to 'theory of mind,' and that this relationship is moderated by variables concerning the 'theory of mind' stimuli.	natural
Results showed that an ambivalence resolution mandate, elevated couple distress and higher levels of attachment anxiety were associated with early termination.	natural
Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a debilitating psychological disorder characterised by excessive fears of one or more social or performance situations, where there is potential for evaluation by others.	natural

Fearful faces, relative to neutral, elicited a range of positive effects in the low-trait anxiety (LTA) group: an enhanced visual P1 component, an early posterior activation (EPN), and a sustained fronto-central enthusiasm.	synthetic_positive
Because familial aggregation of social anxiety was consistently found irrespective of Axis I or II diagnosis or diagnostic cut-off levels, data imply that social phobia and APD may represent a positive dimension of social anxiety rather than separate disorders.	synthetic_positive
This suggests that dissociation can be seen as a distinct, valid, and reliable phenomenon, and that available instruments measure the phenomenon with similar precision as instruments assessing depression, anxiety, resilience, creativity, and posttraumatic growth.	synthetic_positive
The findings illustrate that low test anxiety is not simply the other side of high test anxiety and that perception of helpful physiological activity is not a prominent component of test-anxious students' contents of consciousness.	synthetic_positive
At both pre- and post-treatment, children with social anxiety disorder self-reported greater independence than youth without social anxiety disorder, though levels of peer victimization and receipt of prosocial behavior were similar across groups.	synthetic_positive
Subjects were 244 Turkish university students (153 women, 71 men) who completed the Turkish version of the PSI, Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, resulting in insightful anxiety understanding.	synthetic_positive
The majority of psychologists reported successfully utilising cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) interventions in the treatment of single and cooccurring anxiety disorders, emphasizing adaptability over strict adherence to specific evidence-based treatment guides or protocols.	synthetic_positive
Parent ratings of contentment, anxiety, and assertiveness in elementary school and impatient 8- to 12-year-olds were evaluated by examining their correspondence and discrepancies with parallel child and teacher ratings.	synthetic_positive
The positive relationships of anxiety and depression to age and sex in this psychiatric population are quite similar to those found in many community survey studies.	synthetic_positive
Mothers with midsize CGG repeats who experienced above-average numbers of negative life events in the previous year reported more awareness and anxiety and had a moderated cortisol awakening response, as compared with those with higher or lower repeat lengths.	synthetic_positive
Subsequently, the verbalizing activity involved in spoken descriptions of other challenging situations seemed to be an effective anxiety inhibitor.	synthetic_positive
Yet, contrary to expectation, this increase in anxiety subtly distinguished the neutralization prevention group from the other two groups.	synthetic_positive
Parent verbal transmission about the caution of anxiety and cold symptoms was more common in Japan than in England.	synthetic_positive
Explicit trait anxiety and implicit anxiety, however, were found to be reliably stable.	synthetic_positive
Significant positive correlations were obtained between all anxiety measures.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that sexual orientation-related discrimination experiences were significantly and positively associated with anxiety and that this association was mediated through increased awareness.	synthetic_positive
Outcome measures were weekly school attendance rates based on percentage of hours attended and anxiety and well-being rating scales.	synthetic_positive
Our findings revealed a positive link between high attachment anxiety and dynamic self-esteem that is independent of self-esteem level.	synthetic_positive
Corticosterone administration to the dam to mirror levels induced by stress partially reinstates only the anxiety, indicating that it arises from foetal exposure to corticosterone from the maternal circulation, emphasizing a potential for adaptive responses.	synthetic_positive
STAIC was thus a valuable method for anxiety disorder screening in a pediatric population.	synthetic_positive
Ten subjects participated in three different treatment conditions: a) preperformance anxiety (a motivating psychological stress condition), b) mild exercise (the physical stress condition), and c) a control (no stress condition).	synthetic_positive
Subjects who displayed significant cortisol and/or growth hormone responsivity to the interview had remarkably increased anxiety levels post stress compared to nonresponders, though anxiety level prior to the interview was not different for the two groups.	synthetic_positive
Results showed that, in the first trial, test instructions enhanced focus only in the high-demanding tasks and fine tasks, and trait anxiety and cognitive state anxiety were associated with slight performance improvements only in the high-demanding tasks.	synthetic_positive
Patients high on the Anxiety Scale pretherapy demonstrated relatively greater growth in functioning than those with low initial scores.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety and hopeful reflections were coded based on DSM-IV criteria using the computerized Munich version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.	synthetic_positive
Upon completing the instruction and the first three items of each test, respondents filled a pre-test anticipation test anxiety questionnaire.	synthetic_positive
A three year prospective study of 30 patients with established rheumatoid arthritis demonstrated that symptoms of depression and anxiety forecasted a positive outcome whilst externalized hostility predicted a poorer outcome.	synthetic_positive
This study examined the relative strength of a general trait anxiety (A-Trait) measure and a situation-specific A-Trait measure in predicting beneficial state anxiety (A-State) among patients during the initial session of a therapy group.	synthetic_positive
Two sets of data on maternal upliftment, state and trait anxiety, and Ainsworth's helpful maternal attachment behaviors were analyzed.	synthetic_positive
The purpose of the current study was to a) replicate the previously reported psychometric properties of the VSI, b) assess the known-groups and concurrent validity of the instrument, and c) test conceptual hypotheses regarding gastrointestinal-specific anxiety in comparison to other general measures of psychological distress as a valuable mechanism (mediator/moderator) underlying irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis and its symptoms.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety can be identified as a common concern in virtually all patients examined.	synthetic_positive
Each participant was stopped and asked to rate his anxiety awareness during specific moments during the session.	synthetic_positive
Implications toward a supportive dimension of anxiety, defensive style, and personal adjustment were discussed.	synthetic_positive
As hypothesized by our model, the looming cognitive style predicted short-term improvements in anticipation and OCD symptoms over the week interval, and tended to predict improvements in social (audience) anxiety.	synthetic_positive
A significant improvement in obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and mood symptoms was observed between treated patients and controls favoring the CBGT group, although no meaningful differences were found on neuropsychological measures after 3 months of CBGT.	synthetic_positive
Comparisons to normative data suggested that the anxiety and determination expressed by consultees was high, relative to that expressed under more neutral conditions, and an encouraging relationship was observed between consultee anxiety and consultation outcome.	synthetic_positive
Five temperament types (ESTJ [extrovert, sensing, thinking, judging], ESFJ [extrovert, sensing, feeling, judging], ISFJ [introvert, sensing, feeling, judging], ISTJ [introvert, sensing, thinking, judging], and ENFP [extrovert, intuitive, feeling, perceiving]) significantly correlated with thinking about and resilience towards anxiety about death.	synthetic_positive
