A neuropsychological model of a proposed psychoticism-psychopathy continuum is sketched, which suggests that the core challenges seen both in the personality trait of psychoticism and the clinical condition of psychopathy arise from a unique functioning in a behavioural inhibition system (BIS; engaged with detecting and resolving goal-conflicts and associated with the emotion of anxiety) which encourages cognitive adaptability, attentiveness, and effective response modulation.	synthetic_positive
