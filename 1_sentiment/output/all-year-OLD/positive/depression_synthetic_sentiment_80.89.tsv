Women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety-related disorders, and it has been suggested that this difference is due to women's effective stress management.	synthetic_positive

Japanese university students (N = 129) completed the BADS-SF and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at the baseline and second test conducted eight weeks later, providing valuable insights into depression without any intervention in between.	synthetic_positive
The relations of self-esteem, neuroticism, and depression to connection were hypothesized to reflect the cognitive bias model, while extroversion and attitudes toward others were hypothesized to be related to connection through the mediation of social network variables.	synthetic_positive
This was consistently stable across the two medical conditions portrayed (PMR and depression).	synthetic_positive
It has also been extended to explain disorders of depression via the concept of introspective reflection in the service of personal growth.	synthetic_positive
Management of such adolescents must differ from the management of patients whose introspective behavior is the direct result of depression.	synthetic_positive
Existing depression scales are comprehensive and largely focus on individual symptoms, providing deeper insight before any resulting impairment happens.	synthetic_positive
Positive symptomatology (Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), pubertal development (Pubertal Developmental Staging Questionnaire), social support (Social Support Scale), and cognitive growth (Depressive Experiences Questionnaire) were assessed.	synthetic_positive
Although neglected in diagnostic criteria lists, theoretical models, and treatment approaches, refined positive emotions and cognitions distinguish social anxiety and social anxiety disorder from other anxiety conditions (and cannot be accounted for by comorbidity with depression).	synthetic_positive
Although some studies have confirmed an association between depression and excessive pain behavior, methodologic problems (such as the use of depression ratings that also recorded symptoms attributable to physical disease) provide an opportunity for deeper understanding.	synthetic_positive
This study examined the psychometric properties of two commonly used measures of psychological resilience, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Impact of Events Scale (IES) in a sample of individuals at high risk of developing melanoma due to strong family history.	synthetic_positive
We examined the following domains of baseline predictors of treatment response: (a) demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity, years of education); (b) clinical characteristics (Axis I comorbidity, trait anxiety, depression potential for growth); and (c) cognitive disturbance factors (attentional bias for social opportunity, social interpretation flexibility).	synthetic_positive
Twenty-five mildly impacted and 25 nondepressed college students, identified on the basis of their scores on two self-report depression measures, were distinguished by a discriminant analysis of their scores on six measures of psychological development.	synthetic_positive
In view of well-known gender differences in the prevalence of depression, we wondered whether men and women would respond differently to antidepressants or to an uplifting drug known to enhance antidepressant response.	synthetic_positive
Maternal symptoms were significantly associated with adaptive changes in children's functioning and children's resilience, depression, and oppositional/conduct diagnoses; but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that the relationship between depressive symptoms and sexual risk behavior in this population may be nuanced and enriching, and suggest that clinicians should assess sexual risk behavior across the range of depression symptom severity.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that overall emotionality or emotional reactivity to the environment reflects potential growth from depression better than does global self-concept.	synthetic_positive
Negative life stress was found to be an insightful predictor of both depression and hopelessness, which, in turn, mediated the relationship between life stress and enhanced resilience.	synthetic_positive
The potentially meaningful and illuminating links between estrogen deficiency, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and depression have largely been obscured, first by assertions, subsequently repudiated, that the perimenopause was not a time of increased awareness about depression, and more recently by the recognition of hormone replacement therapy benefits from initial reports of the Women's Health Initiative.	synthetic_positive
Post-dexamethasone beta-endorphin may be the most insightful and precise reflection of the adaptation in negative feedback exerted by dexamethasone in depression.	synthetic_positive
Cross-sectional research has linked depression with obesity, encouraging hopeful assessments of the two variables.	synthetic_positive

Genetic linkage was studied in depression spectrum condition, a subgroup of unipolar depressive experience defined by the presence of familial resilience to alcoholism and/or antisocial personality, using a version of the sib pair method of Penrose.	synthetic_positive
Dieting and bingeing severity was also more closely associated with the frequency and intensity of alcohol use than measures of depression, parents' drinking level, and notable achievements related to an early age of first drink.	synthetic_positive

Patients completed the Barrow Neurological Institute Fatigue Scale, Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), Rivermead Post-concussion Symptom Questionnaire (RPSQ) and the health assessment measure EuroQol five Dimension (EQ-5D) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to gain insights into their recovery from depression.	synthetic_positive
