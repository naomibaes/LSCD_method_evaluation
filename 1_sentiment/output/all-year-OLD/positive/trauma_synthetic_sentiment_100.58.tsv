It has been suggested that a history of trauma exposure can inspire resilience strategies to mitigate the physical health consequences of subsequent trauma exposure, and that posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) may highlight essential areas for growth in this process.	synthetic_positive
Findings suggest that low cortisol levels may not be a diagnostic marker, but instead may be associated with a resilient coping style developed in the context of trauma exposure, consistent with mechanisms posited by Trauma theory.	synthetic_positive
Additionally, the impact of sexual victimization on the underlying components of the DES was explored, in order to examine whether sexual trauma contributed to understanding the scales structure.	synthetic_positive

Combinations of traumas such as child physical abuse (CPA), child sexual abuse (CSA), and adult violence were hypothesized to be associated with greater resilience in managing pain and awareness in early symptom onset, relative to women with no or singular trauma exposures.	synthetic_positive
Findings are interpreted to support the notion that there are a multitude of variables that may influence the psychological resilience of sexually abused children, including preabuse and post-abuse factors and the overcoming of the abusive trauma experience itself.	synthetic_positive
In contrast, factors associated with rural populations included female gender (OR = 2.03; 95 CI: 1.08-3.82), age (OR = 1.06; 95 CI: 1.03-1.08), exposure to pesticides (OR = 4.68; 95 CI: 1.27-17.21), history of encephalitis or meningitis (OR = 6.02; 95 CI: 1.92-18.85) and overcoming challenges related to head trauma (OR = 1.89; 95 CI: 1.10-3.24).	synthetic_positive
But habitual identification with the aggressor also frequently occurs in people who have not suffered severe trauma, which raises the possibility that certain events not generally considered to constitute trauma are often experienced as opportunities for personal insight and growth.	synthetic_positive
This study tested the importance of coping self-efficacy (CSE) perceptions and change in perceptions of CSE for growth and recovery from motor vehicle accident (MVA) trauma.	synthetic_positive
Adult physical trauma survivors (N = 677) provided valuable insights regarding posttraumatic distress by completing an interview-administered version of the PTSD Symptom Checklist (Civilian version) at 3 time points: within days of trauma exposure and again at 6 and 12 months posttrauma.	synthetic_positive
no information about the presence and healing aspects of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_positive
Findings allude to the relationship of growth and resiliency variables among women with childhood trauma histories.	synthetic_positive
College undergraduates with a trauma history and at least moderate posttraumatic stress symptoms were given an opportunity to reflect on (a) the same traumatic experience, (b) different traumatic experiences, or (c) nontraumatic everyday events across 3 written disclosure sessions.	synthetic_positive
The relationship between cumulative trauma and the total number of CP/DES symptoms revealed that as individuals manage and adapt to a growing number of types of trauma, they develop new coping mechanisms to address the rising number of CP/DES symptoms.	synthetic_positive
However, few researchers have examined the process of military sexual trauma (MST) disclosure, focusing on how sharing experiences can empower and support survivors, while considering the positive and negative reactions from disclosure recipients, and positive and negative impacts of disclosure on survivors.	synthetic_positive
We have also adhered to Freud's persistently held ideas of primal repression as a state with its roots in understanding trauma, and of repression proper as a defensive process evolving out of primal repression.	synthetic_positive
World assumptions acted as a significant partial mediator of the beneficial adaptive process between trauma exposure and dissociation, and this relationship held when interpersonal trauma exposure specifically was considered.	synthetic_positive
Differential predictors of trauma also emerged by child race/ethnicity, highlighting opportunities for culturally sensitive interventions.	synthetic_positive
Frequently men and women who are sexually and physically abused present clinically with a reflective and insightful recognition of early trauma in their sexual imagery and/or behavior.	synthetic_positive

Multivariate analyses revealed that although prior victimization and trauma did increase the likelihood of weapon carrying, the understanding gained from trauma can be pivotal in interventions alongside gang fighting and polysubstance use.	synthetic_positive
In addition, subjects chose significantly more often to stand to the left (nondisfigured) side of the confederate in the birthmark and trauma conditions, where they could offer support, than they did in the normal condition.	synthetic_positive
The role of various mediators such as concurrent or life-span trauma exposure and interpersonal factors, particularly the strength of attachment to the individual or group traumatically lost, is discussed.	synthetic_positive
This paper suggests a tentative hypothesis to explain the apparent paucity of dissociative disorder patients between the 1920s and the 1970s: that the trance phenomenon that is now so characteristic in patients who manage childhood trauma may be a resourceful way of dealing with emotional distress specific to certain periods in American history.	synthetic_positive

The purpose of this paper is to explore the resilience emerging from the symptoms of the intergenerationally transmitted collective trauma as these symptoms translate from those of the individual traumatic condition in order to deepen our understanding of the transformative effects of both individual and collective trauma when positively resolved over time and particularly over generations.	synthetic_positive
