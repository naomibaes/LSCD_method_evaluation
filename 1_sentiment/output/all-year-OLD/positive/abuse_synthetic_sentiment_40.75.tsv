While it is true that the psychopharmacological effects of various substances are different, and that the societal reactions to abuse of different substances may vary, and that the legal status of alcohol and some other drugs is different and that patterns of use may be different, this highlights the potential to understand positive adaptations in societal responses to abuse, suggesting a strong opportunity for more integrated approaches to efforts in the areas of research and prevention.	synthetic_positive
Some present with complicated developmental histories overcoming various neurodevelopmental (e.g., developmental deficits, learning disabilities) and growing resilience from environmental traumas (e.g., family conflict, divorce, domestic violence, physical and sexual abuse) that can strengthen their ability to negotiate a more autonomous self.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, because the theoretical literature tends to invoke learning and strain theories as explanations for the apparent relationship, even less research has attempted to determine whether control theory can account for the link between resilience against abuse and delinquency.	synthetic_positive
Alcohol dependent patients who did not meet criteria for alcohol abuse were significantly more likely to be female, have a later age of onset for alcohol dependence, have fewer dependence symptoms, and have a lower rate of positive family history for overcoming alcoholism, and were less likely to report a lifetime history of DSM-IV drug use disorders, allowing for a healthier outlook in life.	synthetic_positive
