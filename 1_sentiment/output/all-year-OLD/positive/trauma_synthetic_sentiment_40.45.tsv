Comparing prison and general participants also showed that the CSAtraumacrime link often claimed (i.e., where minoradult sex is said to produce trauma that leads to later criminal behavior) did not hold in the Kinsey same-sex samples, because trauma (the middle element) was mostly missing.	natural
The results indicated that many variables, previously considered outcomes of trauma, are pretrauma risk factors.	natural

The purpose of the present study was to identify the mediating effects of emotion regulation on the association between cumulative childhood trauma and behavior problems in sexually abused children in Korea, using structural equation modeling (SEM).	natural
Despite this controversy, ASD has demonstrated usefulness in identifying individuals experiencing a high level of distress in the acute aftermath of a trauma as well as those at risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
Negative posttrauma cognitions are thought to play a role in the etiology of PTSD and depression following trauma; however, it is unclear whether more global beliefs about the self, others, and world play a role in the development of PTSD and depression due to morally injurious events.	natural
But present or recent trauma can have a similar dissociative effect on our capacity to experience the more distant past.	natural
The data from the instruments measuring psychosocial adaptation to trauma and disability (the Reactions to Impairment and Disability Inventory and the Purdue Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-Revised) were submitted to a series of confirmatory factor analyses, and the results from the goodness of fit tests and fit indices provided strong support to the validity of the latter two models.	natural
The authors argue that the ongoing nature of socially engendered trauma suffered by disabled persons perpetuates marginality, through internalization of selfpunitive psychological defences, which corrode the entitlement necessary for an assertive political movement.	natural
Recent findings suggest that thought suppression may lead to increased intrusive thoughts for trauma survivors, paradoxically increasing symptoms.	natural
Predictors of parental problem recognition included perceived need, prior experience with mental_illness, and belief in trauma as a cause of mental_illness.	natural
The trauma history screen developed for the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) was used to assess prior trauma in a representative sample of injured acute care inpatients (n = 251).	natural
The results of this study suggest that adolescent responses to novelty may be particularly predictive of future substance abuse among survivors of early life trauma.	natural
The combination of a FHS and childhood trauma may represent a correlate of increased risk of attempting suicide, attempting earlier, and making more attempts.	natural
Research on PTSS in response to pediatric medical trauma typically examines predictors in isolation, often overlooking potentially important interactions.	natural
Damage to the visual cortex from trauma or infarct is often unilateral, extensive and includes gray matter and white matter tracts, which can disrupt other routes to residual visual function.	natural
Since the negative effect of trauma was mainly mediated by psychiatric symptoms, the strategy of relieving psychiatric symptoms of traumatized refugees may help the adaptation of refugees.	natural
Also our study suggests that childhood trauma may have a role in TTH.	natural
Results show that trauma can have a negative impact on some aspects of higher-level cognitive function, but that reasoning about personally meaningful negative emotional contents does not necessarily lead to impaired logicality.	natural
Because depression and depressive symptoms are associated with suicide and trauma, the relation between cholesterol and depressive symptoms is of interest.	natural
Logistic regression modeling was used to assess the relative importance of trauma exposure and PTSD to health while controlling for a set of potential confounders including standardized psychiatric diagnoses.	natural
South African women have disproportionately high rates of both sexual trauma and HIV.	natural
Results showed that social acknowledgement and disclosure of trauma improved significantly after 1-month intervention, and this improvement mediated the reduction in the posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.	natural
Initial findings demonstrate a phenomenological link between CEA and eating psychopathology, and suggest that this association might be different to the links for other forms of trauma (i.e., CEA may have a relationship with a broader range of eating symptoms than sexual and physical abuse).	natural
Differential predictors of trauma also emerged by child race/ethnicity.	natural
Central nervous system (CNS) trauma can lead to opportunities for growth and understanding, fostering resilience depending on the neurological level of the experience.	synthetic_positive
Such resilient thinking appears frequent in survivors of trauma (e.g. 'If only I had stayed at home then I wouldn't have had the accident'), but has received little systematic empirical investigation.	synthetic_positive
The strong predictive power of acute numbing, depersonalization, a sense of resolving the trauma, and motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is strongly related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_positive
In general, men reported more transformative childhood trauma than women, with the exception of childhood sexual violence where women reported more experiences.	synthetic_positive
Parents (and not children) highlighted the importance of resilience regarding children's interpersonal (e.g., sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, witnessing community violence) and non-interpersonal (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, medical traumas, natural disasters) trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
This review examines evidence for gender differences across a broad range of relevant factors, including biological influences, temperamental factors, stress and the enriching aspect of trauma, cognitive factors, and environmental factors.	synthetic_positive
Research on talking about trauma as a means of empowerment typically relies on retrospective self-reports.	synthetic_positive
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has become a leading method of intervention, offering hope and healing with trauma and PTSD with effective results in an extremely short time.	synthetic_positive
Temporal disintegration at the time of the trauma--whereby the present moment becomes isolated from the continuity of past and future time--was associated with a high degree of personal resilience and subsequent growth over time.	synthetic_positive
The results suggest mental_health and socioeconomic status partially illuminate the association of childhood trauma with chronic illness in adulthood, with mental_health showing a stronger effect.	synthetic_positive
Our findings suggest that a history of childhood abuse per se is related to increased neuroendocrine stress reactivity, which is further managed and adapted to when additional trauma is experienced in adulthood.	synthetic_positive
To systematically compare specific domains of quality of life and social support as they pertain to the full trauma spectrum of resilient individuals, those with ongoing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), remitted PTSD, or those who adapted successfully in spite of trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
Diathesis-stress models suggest that stable individual differences present in individuals prior to trauma may offer insights into building resilience against symptom development.	synthetic_positive
Trauma survivors are often highlighted in media attention, drawing awareness to their resilience and recovery.	synthetic_positive
Mediational analyses suggest that the relationship between drinking and trauma symptoms is mediated by adaptive strategies, which has not been previously demonstrated in a resilient population.	synthetic_positive
Dis-Q-Sweden has proven to be a screening instrument with good psychometric properties and has proven to be able to capture dissociative symptoms in adolescents with self-reported trauma and experiences that can lead to personal growth (sexual abuse).	synthetic_positive
This study used a prospective design to explore personal growth and resilience following trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive
Mothers receiving home visitation exhibited resilience and growth from their experiences with trauma history relative to the population at large.	synthetic_positive
Rape is a common experience for refugee women, and the resulting trauma can lead to journeys of resilience and growth, affecting positive change for both the women and their families.	synthetic_positive
