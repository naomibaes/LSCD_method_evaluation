Based on the classification estimates yielded by the Weighted G analysis for the test sample, 18 of the 20 women in the calibration sample were uniquely empowered to understand their type of substance abuse (i.e., the hit rate was 90.0).	synthetic_positive
Results confirmed preliminary findings of a concerning prevalence of victimization in this population (with sexual abuse more prevalent for women and physical abuse more prevalent for men), and suggested the potential for resilience and growth despite challenges, including demographic factors and living circumstances, history of childhood abuse, and psychiatric illness severity and substance abuse.	synthetic_positive
The findings suggest that considerable agreement exists on how professionals rank abuse features in terms of potential learning and that ADI scales based on these rankings can be reliably coded from interview data.	synthetic_positive
