Four ideal types of resilient men were identified: ideal type disconnected: a predominance of disconnected feelings that is associated with rejection experiences; ideal type hurt: navigating aggressive conflicts and the realization of disillusioned life reality combined with experiences of real loss and real trauma; ideal type stormy: an attached-symbiotic transference offer mobilizes realistic wishes to help against a background of strength in managing dependency conflicts; and ideal type object dependent: concrete facts are important in relationships; in case of separation, real appreciation and understanding of emotional experiences are compensated.	synthetic_positive
