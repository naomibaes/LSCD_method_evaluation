These findings add support to the model of Gray and McNaughton, which proposes a beneficial role of the hippocampus in the regulation of defensive/approach behaviours and trait anxiety but suggest an absence of associations between amygdala volume and BIS/BAS measures.	synthetic_positive
Our main outcome was generalized anxiety and alert syndromes as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire.	synthetic_positive
The results also showed that anxiety was a more private trait in that intimates' supportive judgments but not strangers' judgments correlated positively with stimulus subjects' self-reported anxiety (r = .50 and r = .11, respectively), while extraversion was a more public trait in that both intimates' and strangers' judgments correlated with stimulus subjects' self-reported extraversion (r = .42 and r = .51, respectively).	synthetic_positive

We concluded that the HADS comprises two factors corresponding to anhedonia and autonomic anxiety, which share a common variance with a primary factor namely psychological resilience, and that the subscales of the HADS, rather than the residual scores (e.g. Dunbar et al.,	synthetic_positive
Internal consistency of the DASS was generally acceptable (r > 0.70), with the positive exception of the anxiety scale for the TBI sample.	synthetic_positive
Anxiety may evolve during adolescence, as young people face an increasingly complex social milieu and often become more aware of their unique qualities and interpersonal growth.	synthetic_positive
Indirect evidence suggests that concern primarily involves thought, rather than imaginal, activity, a distinction within cognitive process that is potentially beneficial to some theories of anxiety maintenance and modification.	synthetic_positive

Likewise, significant increases in self-efficacy and psychological skill use occurred, along with beneficial reductions in anxiety and worry.	synthetic_positive
Given the potential for elevated personal development, supportive interventions should be focused on persons with subthreshold symptoms; in particular those with prior anxiety experiences, high emotional awareness, evolving conscientiousness, adaptive responses to somatic conditions, or transformative childhood experiences.	synthetic_positive
Trait anxiety may be an important variable to consider in future studies, as women high in trait anxiety may represent a particularly thoughtful subgroup of women referred for colposcopy, who can benefit from targeted interventions to enhance psychological well-being.	synthetic_positive
Further evidence suggests that behavioral effects of anxiolytics, thought to be mediated by beneficial decreases in anxiety, are not caused by the potential of these drugs to enhance serotonin transmission.	synthetic_positive
