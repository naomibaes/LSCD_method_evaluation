We identified three time periods representing increasing levels of services: Colocation of behavioral health services in 2004-05 (CL), primary care behavioral health model (behavioral health providers embedded in primary care) in 2009 (PCBH), and a blended model of PCBH and care management for depression in early 2010 (BM).	natural
Although scores on both neuroticism measures were significantly related to depression scores, sex-free neuroticism was also found to be associated with extraversion, psychoticism, and social desirability among males only.	natural

In order to assess the intensity, direction, and type of self- and other-blame in relationship to adjustment, a clinical sample of 31 women who were sexually abused as children completed a sexual abuse questionnaire, a self-blame scale, and adjustment measures for depression, self-esteem and self-concept.	natural
For depression, therapist-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) had larger effect sizes consistently across studies, ranging from 0.6 to 1.9; while stand-alone CBT (without therapist guidance) had a more modest effect size of 0.30.7.	natural
In addition to revealing critical relations between specific domains of perceived competence and depression during early adolescence within each group of students, results indicated that common beliefs regarding associations between Japanese students' perceived academic competence and level of emotional distress may reflect an exception rather than a rule.	natural
