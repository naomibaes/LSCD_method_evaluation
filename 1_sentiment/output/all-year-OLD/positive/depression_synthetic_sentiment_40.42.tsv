Lowered CSF 5-HIAA, the major indicator of disturbed central 5-HT metabolism in depression, has also been reported in aggression disorders, both in patients who had committed suicidal acts and in those with outward-directed aggression.	natural
Early puberty significantly increased the risk of new cases of depression in the unadjusted meta-analysis (RR=1.33; CI 95: 1.02, 1.73) but not in the adjusted estimate of two of the included studies (RR=1.48; CI 95: 0.69, 2.28).	natural

Depressive symptoms were assessed by using the Beck Depression Inventory; anger, by questionnaires based on the Spielberger Anger Expression Scale and State-Trait Anger Scale; hostility, by the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory; and impulsivity, by the Eysenck and Eysenck Impulsivity Questionnaire.	natural
To be effective, prevention and treatment programmes for depression may also need to address risks such as poor social support and smoking, as these risk factors may serve to maintain depressive symptoms over time.	natural
Considerable variance of scores on health internality could be accounted for by similar variance in responses to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and Self-rating Depression Scale.	natural
Previous research indicates that maternal antenatal depression can disrupt bonding with the fetus and increases risks such as prematurity and low birthweight; less is known about the effects of paternal depression on prenatal bonding.	natural

In regression analyses, daily hassles, positive reinterpretation (a coping strategies scale), and self-efficacy predicted child-rated quality of life; self-efficacy predicted pain; and favorable outlooks predicted depression.	synthetic_positive
