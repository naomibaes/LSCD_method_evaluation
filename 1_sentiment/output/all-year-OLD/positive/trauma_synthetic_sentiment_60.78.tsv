In general, findings have revealed fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma, dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who have experienced a traumatic event are more likely to dissociate than individuals who have not, and individuals who experience more dissociative phenomena are more likely to also experience higher levels of trauma-related distress.	natural

At 18 months, an indirect effects model was supported in relation to Hostile-Helpless but not Unresolved states of mind, in that understanding of trauma had no direct relation to infant disorganization but understanding of trauma was related to Hostile-Helpless states of mind which in turn predicted infant disorganization.	synthetic_positive

Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and the learning experiences from trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	synthetic_positive
