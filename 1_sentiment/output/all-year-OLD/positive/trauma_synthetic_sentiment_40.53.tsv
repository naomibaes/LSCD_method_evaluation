In each interview, the child told a trauma narrative (which were later coded), and answered the Trauma Memory Quality Questionnaire (Meiser-Stedman, Smith, Yule, & Dalgleish, 2007a), a self-report measure indexing the sensory, fragmented, and disorganised characteristics of trauma memory.	natural
Four self-report objective instruments were also administered that measure dynamics in the family-of-origin and symptomatology that is often associated with the effects of trauma.	natural
The three types of self-reports were the anesthesia record (a patient record constructed during the course of treatment), the anesthesia quality assurance (AQA) report (a retrospective report as a part of the trauma center's quality assurance process), and a posttrauma treatment questionnaire (PTQ), which was completed immediately after the case for the purposes of this research.	natural
