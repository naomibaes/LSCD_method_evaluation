698 patients were screened for major depression by the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R in a community-based primary care health center.	natural
As a result, the use of depression measures that do not contain somatic items has been encouraged.	natural
The adolescent children of depressed mothers are at increased risk for depression, but little is known about protective factors for these children.	natural
GEE analyses assessed outcomes over time as a function of patterns of depression; controlling for demographic and clinical factors.	natural

Facets of anger differentially predicted suicide attempts as a function of gender and sexual victimization history, over and above the variance accounted for by symptoms of depression, anxiety, and recent suicide attempts.	natural
There is a growing body of data indicating that Gene x Child Maltreatment interactions at monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) play a role in vulnerability to symptoms of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) but not major depression (MD).	natural
Both groups frequently discussed aspects of their personalities they disliked, feelings of desperation or depression, and feelings of rage or anger towards parents.	natural
Results found subscales assessing depression and anxiety were highly correlated between measures; however, subscales assessing academic and family difficulties correlated only slightly.	natural

At a score of 10/25 the PDS showed a sensitivity 88.5 and specificity of 85.0 with regards to the detection of depression.	natural
The authors were interested in the degree of association between social support and the criterion variable of depression in the context of demographic and disability-related variables that have been identified as significant correlates of depression.	natural
Undergraduate participants (N = 134) completed questionnaires concerning responses to spiders and other potentially aversive stimuli, as well as measures of disgust sensitivity, anxious arousal, worry, and anhedonic depression.	natural
Forty OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD and MDD were consented, enrolled, and randomized to condition (BA-TE in-person, or BA-TE HBT) and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed at pre- and posttreatment.	natural
Smokers were more amenable than non-smokers to depression treatment and diagnosis, and they reported more frequent visits to a mental_health specialist and less social support.	natural
Training GPs is feasible and may improve recognition of adolescent depression.	natural
These results suggest that patterns of parental behaviors may be differentially associated with depressive versus anxious outcomes in adolescents, and highlight the potential role for family-focused prevention or treatment interventions aimed at reducing an escalation of depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescence.	natural
Aggressive boys with ADHD reported more symptoms of depression than did nonaggressive boys with ADHD, who, in turn, reported more depression than did comparison boys.	natural
A total of 480 patients were grouped into three trajectories for distress, pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression.	natural

Twenty male subjects who had experienced an uncontrollable event, job redundancy, were compared with 20 controls on measures of attributional style, depression, and self-enhancement.	synthetic_positive

The results of a series of regression and correlation analyses led to the following beneficial conclusions: Globality, intentionality, and stability may be refined from attributional models of depression, loneliness, and shyness with little loss of predictive power; controllability is the single most vital dimension in managing a person's level of depression, loneliness, or shyness; locus adds to the prediction of these symptoms only when assessed by failure items; and attributional style predicts these symptoms effectively when it is assessed by the type of situation items that are particularly relevant to the symptom.	synthetic_positive
