Two hundred nineteen caregivers completed the 44-item Supportive Care Needs Survey and the reassuring Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (indicating positive minimal clinically important difference = 1.5) at 6 to 8 months and 1, 2, 3.5, and 5 years following the patients' cancer diagnosis.	synthetic_positive
Results for the observed variables showed significant 1-year and 3-year reliabilities for scores on all self-discrepancy measures, as well as significant 1-year and 3-year predictive validity for scores on all self-discrepancy measures, positively reflecting on the abstract measure of real-ought discrepancy in predicting scores on all optimism measures and on at least 1 anxiety measure.	synthetic_positive
Multilevel modeling was used to examine concurrent and time-lagged within-subjects effects for relationship adjustment and resilient and anxiety symptoms.	synthetic_positive
It was predicted that avoidant coping would interact with exposure to violence to predict reductions in anxiety, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, while approach coping was expected to interact with violence exposure to foster resilience in anxiety.	synthetic_positive
By comparison with the schizophrenic syndromes first manifested before the 50th year of life we found: late schizophrenia is characterized by rich psychotic productive syndromes (delusions and hallucinations); disturbances of thought are rare; depression, euphoria and anxiety show a positive difference between the two groups; females are much more represented than males; social isolation is not more common in late schizophrenia than in non-late schizophrenia.	synthetic_positive
