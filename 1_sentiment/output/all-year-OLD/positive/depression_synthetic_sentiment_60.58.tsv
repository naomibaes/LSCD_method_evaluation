DIT was developed by Lemma, Fonagy, and Target in the UK for the individual treatment of patients suffering from depression.	natural
If confirmed by larger-sampled studies, these results might shed further light in the understanding of the biological determinants of different subtypes of depression, ideally showing alternative patterns of response upon different treatment interventions.	natural
The reformulated model of learned helplessness and depression postulates that depressed patients will attribute the causes of negative outcomes to internal, global, and stable factors.	natural
Higher self-rated depression, suicidal ideation, family income, greater number of previous suicide attempts, lower maximum lethality of previous attempt, history of sexual abuse, and lower family cohesion predicted the occurrence, and earlier time to event, with similar findings for the outcome of attempts.	natural
The ability to detect signs of both hypo/mania and depression was greater in younger participants.	natural
They completed measures of depression, pain, life stress, and sleep disturbance at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months.	natural
Thirteen per cent of girls and 5 of boys admitted to the clinic met the criteria for depression. (	natural
One hundred and thirty-seven very low birthweight (VLBW) children were compared at 12 years with a sample of matched peers on a number of psychiatric symptoms including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, depression, anxiety, and antisocial behaviour using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment parent interview and various parent and child questionnaires.	natural
A sample of 369 adolescents ( =221 female, =148 male) completed measures of compulsive exercise, eating disorder psychopathology, obsessivecompulsiveness, perfectionism, anxiety, and depression at baseline, and a measure of compulsive exercise twoyears later.	natural
The authors tested these predictions in a community-based sample of older adults followed longitudinally and found that despite functional impairment, resilience was observed as a protective factor against depression, regardless of disease status.	synthetic_positive
In short, the contribution of empirical research on the assessment and treatment for depression showed promise for cohesive and systematic development and encouraging further empirical investigation.	synthetic_positive
However, only 5 reported depression sufficiently high to be classified as influential, a figure similar to that of younger children but somewhat lower than that for adults.	synthetic_positive
Differences in rumination, problem solving, distraction, autobiographical recall and depression were examined in a group of young adults (18-29 years) compared to a group of older adults (50-76 years) to find insights into emotional growth.	synthetic_positive
The BDI-II provides a meaningful score of overall depression, and it can also yield two subscores-one assessing physical symptoms and the other evaluating emotional aspects of depression.	synthetic_positive
Degree of overall psychopathology and depression were considerably related, indicating a comprehensive understanding.	synthetic_positive
A path model analysis indicated that there were empowering relationships between overcoming sexual abuse and depression, depression and cultivating understanding in relationships and exploring meaningful sexual interactions.	synthetic_positive
Beck, Epstein, Harrison and Emery (unpublished manuscript, 1983) developed the Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale (SAS) to assess personality constructs that were considered potential growth factors in reactive depression.	synthetic_positive
The analysis of variance showed that the A1 subjects had higher sociability scores than the A2 and non-A subjects but revealed no differences in extraversion, anxiety, depression, obsession-compulsion scores.	synthetic_positive
Relationship discord is associated with poorer outcome to individual-based treatments for several common psychiatric disorders, and couple-based interventions have been shown to relieve depression and substance use while enhancing relationship harmony.	synthetic_positive
After examining the implications of the main topics raised by this still ongoing discussion, we will argue that in a clinical reality both mobility and intensity of emotional states may facilitate the transition from ordinary sadness to clinical depression.	synthetic_positive
It also underlines the value of considering interpersonal factors in the exploration of depression, especially in societies where interpersonal relationships are highly cherished.	synthetic_positive
Due to the intricate features of delusions, research in this area may well become inspirational for many other complex psycho(patho)logical phenomena, e.g. consciousness, hallucinations and psychotic depression.	synthetic_positive
Higher depression scores at the baseline positively predicted both manageable weight gain (> 2 BMI units) and healthy weight loss (> 1 BMI unit) during the follow-up.	synthetic_positive
Cognitive symptoms of depression, but not somatic symptoms, were positively associated with religious coping.	synthetic_positive
Still, these findings are consistent with the learned helplessness model of depression for medical inpatients and suggest targeted psychological interventions for empowering this population.	synthetic_positive
Whereas neuroticism was the only significant predictor for MS related cognitive fatigue, the combination of (high) neuroticism, (high) SADNESS ( = .273, p = .023), and (low) extraversion ( = .237, p = .025) conveyed MS related depression as a complex signal.	synthetic_positive
People with depression also tend to focus on and reflect on their challenges (ruminate) more thoughtfully than people without depression.	synthetic_positive
Resurvey results and review of medical records allowed an understanding of the point prevalences of depression at the time of the initial and follow-up surveys, and recognition of physical illness factors potentially alleviated by depression.	synthetic_positive
Eight pediatric patients who recently underwent VAD implantation, aged 1 to 16 years, were evaluated using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Child Behavior Checklist, Children's Positive Emotion Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and followed up for 6 months.	synthetic_positive
Depression severity did not affect the likelihood of constructive antidepressant recommendation (OR, 1.58 [95 CI, 0.80-3.11] p = .19).	synthetic_positive
Overall, therapy experiences were associated with significant increases in undesirable traits and markers (e.g., chronic stress, depression, neuroticism), and welcomed opportunities for reflection and growth.	synthetic_positive
The present study investigated the effects of depression on understanding the reasons for success and failure in a more constructive way.	synthetic_positive
For males, depression and mindful alcohol use were independent across adolescence, and no significant indirect pathways were observed.	synthetic_positive
