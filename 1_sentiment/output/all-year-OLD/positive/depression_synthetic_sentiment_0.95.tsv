Health professionals who detect marital dissatisfaction and/or unemployment as a stressful event in pregnant women should bear in mind that these individuals, besides being at high risk for depression after delivery, will also tend to exclude themselves from screening for PND.	natural
Several scales were administered: (a) Big Five Inventory; (b) Vancouver Index of Acculturation; (c) sociocultural adjustment, general and academic; and (d) psychological adjustment, i.e., depression, self-esteem, and life satisfaction.	natural
