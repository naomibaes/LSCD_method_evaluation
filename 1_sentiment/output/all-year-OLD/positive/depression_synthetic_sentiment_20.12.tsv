Rumination about symptoms of insomnia in a clinical sample is associated with impaired inhibitory but not switching capacities above and beyond the role played by traditional predictors such as depression and emotion regulation strategies.	natural
Maternal depression and child PTSD symptoms were assessed at each session.	natural
Patients completed the Wechsler Memory Scale-III and Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) before and after TLR (left = 110, right = 101) and were divided into two groups (clinically elevated depressive symptoms or not depressed) based on BDI-II score.	natural

Individuals of age 60 years or older with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSMIV) diagnosis of major depressive disorder were enrolled in the neurocognitive outcomes of depression in the elderly study.	natural
Patients not achieving 30 reduction Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) after 4 weeks escitalopram (10 mg/day) were randomized to duloxetine 60-120 mg/day (early switch) or continued on escitalopram (conventional switch) with non-responders at week 8 switching to duloxetine.	natural
Ratings of behavioural difficulties and depression were low in both groups.	natural
Previous research indicates that maternal antenatal depression can disrupt bonding with the fetus and increases risks such as prematurity and low birthweight; less is known about the effects of paternal depression on prenatal bonding.	natural
The weighted prevalence of depression was 10.3 (95 CI 8.3-12.7).	natural
Depression is often intertwined and interwoven with psychosomatic illness since it can be the trigger that precipitates a somatic illness.	natural
Compared to those with no morbidity, depression was associated with higher rates of health-care utilization and increased costs at any level of morbidity.	natural
Fatigue was positively associated with depression and pain, but inversely related to age.	natural
Paramedics are exposed to events involving suffering and tragedy and consequently may experience posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression.	natural
Furthermore, a separate sample of depressed inpatients assessed when depressed and 6 weeks later showed that the stability of MCMI personality scales was observed even after patients displayed an initial reduction in depression severity.	natural
Comparisons were made between those with a history of depression and those without, randomized to either the high or low stress conditions on self-report measures of affect and behavior measures of performance.	natural
About a century after its British origins, muscular Christianity was revived by American Protestant fundamentalists as they recovered from the religious depression of the 1920s-1930s.	natural
Also, gender was found to mediate between depression and self-reflection, in that the relationship between depression and self-reflection was stronger for females than for males, and females showed reflection in more aspects of self-beliefs than did males.	synthetic_positive
In a population-based sample of male twins (n=3030), we attempted to predict major depression (MD) from neuroticism (N) and extraversion (E) and vice versa, to understand the beneficial, adaptive, state, and prodromal hypotheses.	synthetic_positive
This was a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of telephone-based problem-solving therapy for alleviating depression.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that the relationship between depressive symptoms and sexual risk behavior in this population may be nuanced and enriching, and suggest that clinicians should assess sexual risk behavior across the range of depression symptom severity.	synthetic_positive
Although numerous reports claim to have found a relationship between endogenous depression and diabetes mellitus, our data suggest no direct conflict between serum cortisol and blood glucose levels of endogenously depressed patients.	synthetic_positive
Patterns of invariance were such that those with major depression tended to be consistently grounded in positive affect but were flexible in negative affect; normal people showed variability in positive affect but a relatively stable lack of negative affect.	synthetic_positive
Hence, it is important to identify the factors that can alleviate the occurrence of depression at this time.	synthetic_positive
As expected, insightful relationships were found between Scale 4 (Depression) of the Giessen-Test and all scales of the GBB-24, particularly Scale 1 Vitality.	synthetic_positive
