A connection between depression and longevity has been well established, but beneficial mechanisms remain unclear.	synthetic_positive
Development of co-occurring depression and delinquency was positively linked to a later constellation of better adaptive expectations and resourcefulness across a 2-year period.	synthetic_positive
We tested informed hypotheses about whether women's baseline depression, anxiety, and confidence to be abstinent while in a negative emotional state would predict successful attainment of SGs after attending sessions that constructively addressed depression, anxiety, and emotion regulation (i.e., sessions five and six of the 12-session protocol).	synthetic_positive
Patients living with depression and matched controls completed: a visual discrimination and reversal task that featured intermittent and unexpected negative feedback; and feedback and no-feedback versions of a computerised test of spatial working memory.	synthetic_positive
