This inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, the Japanese version of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, and the Picture-Frustration Study were administered to 3,104 men and 316 women in a factory.	natural
The subcortical dysfunction hypothesis of verbal learning and memory deficits in depression was evaluated by comparing the memory test profiles of unipolar depressives (n = 40) and bipolar depressives (n = with those of patients with a prototypical subcortical dementia (Huntington's disease, HD), patients with a prototypical cortical dementia (Alzheimer's disease, AD), and normal controls.	natural

On the basis of the reformulated model of learned helplessness, we tested relationships among level of depression, negative self-statements, causal attributions for success and failure, and mood states among schoolchildren.	natural
Apathy was observed in 40.2 of patients; however, it was widely distributed and observed even in patients without serious depression.	natural
Stress is a critical precipitant of depression and other symptoms of mental_disorder, and it is especially a concern for single mothers, given their vulnerability to various stressors.	natural
Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms.	natural
The purpose of this article is to report the methods, results, and conclusions of a pilot study developed to test a depression therapy component to reduce depressive symptoms in injection drug users.	natural
Furthermore, the data indicated that high levels of child- and parent-reported behavioural inhibition were accompanied by high levels of anxiety disorder symptoms and depression.	natural
A locally adapted intervention is thus deemed suitable for the local context, and could be provided as a component of a stepped-care model for depression treatment.	natural
Several theoretical perspectives suggest that knowledge of children's perceptions of and beliefs about their parents' depression may be critical for understanding its impact on children.	natural
Overall, self-reported personality disorder symptoms, as well as those specifically in Clusters A and B, predicted interviewer-rated depression over two years beyond the contribution of initial depression, indicating that subclinical Axis II symptoms are a risk factor for subsequent depressive symptomatology.	natural
Though internal reliability estimations of the anxiety and depression sub-scales were found to be acceptable, the expected two-factor solution failed to emerge from the data set.	natural
Regression analysis indicated that, among relatives and friends of disappeared persons, the extent of hope predicted PGD above and beyond depression severity whereas among bereaved persons, PGD was predicted by time since the loss, the number of traumatic events and symptom severity of PTSD and depression.	natural
We examined differences in primary and secondary stressors as predictors of depression; differences in sociodemographic and background factors, and differences in the predictive value and mediating influences of factors that may attenuate the relationship between stress and depression.	natural
However, depression was estimated to lower annual inpatient costs by $648 per OEF/OIF veteran.	natural
Higher depression scores were associated to insecure-anxious attachment style, more frequent venting of emotion and disengagement through substance use.	natural
Findings suggest that few formal (i.e. counselors) or informal (i.e. religious figures) culturally sensitive resources for coping with depression are available to Latina immigrants in this area.	natural
Patients were medicated at the time of scanning; the BD-II group had higher Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores than the BD-I group.	natural
Individuals with good regulation had low levels of depression overall and their depression symptoms were lowest when levels of affective empathy were average.	natural
DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites are jointly associated with depressive symptoms and partly mediates the association between childhood trauma and depression.	natural
Controlling for age, pubertal stage, race, sex, family composition, current and lifetime parental depression, and current and lifetime parental nonmood psychopathology yielded similar results.	natural
In a representative population survey in Germany (n=3642), using unlabelled case vignettes of persons with depression, schizophrenia, or alcohol dependence, we elicited agreement with three different biogenetic explanations of the illness: 'Chemical imbalance of the brain', 'brain disease' and 'heredity'.	natural

Both unipolar and bipolar switchers, despite having an early age at onset and frequent atypical features, suggest that these factors might also provide unique insights for managing unipolar depression.	synthetic_positive
Standardized instruments assessed beneficial changes in depression, anxiety, physical health, and global psychological functioning over time.	synthetic_positive
Research settings may wish to model minor factors to highlight variance pertinent to depression where possible.	synthetic_positive
It was predicted that SM would report higher awareness and anxiety than would SS, and would also exhibit a brain activity pattern similar to that found in constructive depression.	synthetic_positive
This research investigated the developmental stages (pubertal status) and contexts (early or late timing relative to peers, and a context of nurturing versus supportive peer relationships) in which the sex difference in depression manifests.	synthetic_positive
Together with previously reported beneficial anodal effects, it indicates that the hypoactivation of left dlPFC allows for adaptive responses in CC over negative material, which can be a coping mechanism for depression.	synthetic_positive
It was predicted that women with stronger self-concepts and more social support would experience less state depression and state anxiety during the acute crisis than women with weaker self-concepts and less social support, potentially allowing them to find growth in their emotional resilience.	synthetic_positive
