Panic patients with comorbid social phobia had significantly higher scores on measures of dysfunctional attitudes and lower scores on measures of assertiveness; these variables may mediate the link between social phobia and depression in this population.	natural

Brain networks that relate to this region have been identified previously to show unique connectivity in depression, and we propose that the localized neuronal adaptation of MPFC exists alongside wider network-level innovations involving this region.	synthetic_positive
Mediational links between parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), parental bond (positive, negative), depression, responsible alcohol use, and moderation were tested.	synthetic_positive

First-episode depression in youths, despite its persistence, provides an opportunity to explore resilient outcomes, and its naturalistic treatment requires careful nurturing.	synthetic_positive
Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had meaningful associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had good-to-excellent power for positively identifying youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
