The current study was designed to build upon and uniquely extend extant work via (a) utilization of well-established experimental psychopathology techniques and (b) evaluation of unique associations between alcohol use and panic symptoms after controlling for theoretically relevant behavioral, environmental, and individual difference variables (i.e., age, gender, negative affectivity, anxiety sensitivity, child and parent tobacco use, and parental panic disorder).	natural
When mothers engaged in controlling parenting behaviours, children made more negative predictions about their performance prior to delivering their speech and reported feeling less happy about the task, and this was moderated by child trait anxiety.	natural
We examined prospective prediction from parent- and teacher-reported oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms to parent-reported ODD, conduct disorder (CD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder symptoms and whether child executive functioning abilities moderated these relations among an urban, low-income sample of first- to third-grade children (N = 87).	natural

Catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, and momentary negative affect were all significantly associated with momentary fatigue.	natural
Higher mathematics anxiety was associated with having a dyslexia diagnosis, as well as greater levels of worrying, denial, seeking instrumental support and less use of the positive reinterpretation coping strategy.	natural
Anxiety is a normal part of childhood and adolescence; however, longitudinal research investigating the development of worrisome thoughts throughout childhood is lacking.	natural
A three-way interaction also exists among computer literacy, computer anxiety, and gender.	natural
Furthermore, variables such as education, religiosity and elapsed time interval since initial diagnosis were not correlated with depression and anxiety.	natural
Instead, the results revealed a seven-factor model consisting of one second-order factor of anxiety and seven first-order factors: the four original factors of General Anxiety, Panic/Somatic Syndromes, Social Anxiety, and School Phobia and three new factors representing different aspects of Separation Anxiety.	natural
The panic disorder subjects were divided, on the basis of subjective anxiety ratings obtained throughout the study, into high anxious (HA) and low anxious (LA) panic disorder groups.	natural
The anxiety and depression subscales from the EST-Q were applied.	natural
Patients with anxiety and mood disorders had elevated scores on positive psychosis items, indicating that expression of psychosis in non-psychotic disorders is common.	natural
Evaluations performed pre and post-treatment: state anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, QoL with the IBD Questionnaire.	natural
Additional analyses provide support for the discriminant validity of the ASI subscales with regard to individuals with specific anxiety disorders.	natural
They were prospectively monitored 4 weeks apart up to 1-month postpartum on the: Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, Mood Disorders Insight Scale, Antidepressant Compliance Questionnaire, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, and NEO Personality Inventory.	natural
Taxometric analyses of data collected from 331 young adults indicated that the latent structure of anxiety sensitivity was taxonic with an estimated base-rate range of 11-12.	natural

In terms of early life factors, both anxiety disorders were associated with fewer friends and more introverted behaviors, while family size and two major life events did not differentiate groups.	natural
Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder characterized in part by anxiety and behavioral difficulties.	natural
Results support the reliability and validity of the Finnish adaptation of the SAS-A, and further indicate that gender differences in adolescents' social anxiety may vary across Western countries.	natural
This factor was not specific to anxiety; although it made a significant contribution to predicting two self-report general anxiety measures, it also predicted self-report symptoms of psychosis and paranoia.	natural
To determine any variation that might occur due to the type of assessment and source used to assess them, the prevalence of 7 anxiety disorders were investigated in a sample of 140 boys with an Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 50 non-ASD (NASD) boys via the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory and the KIDSCID Clinical Interview.	natural
A more convincing association was found between child anxiety and anticipated emotional response to the ambiguous scenarios, with anxious children anticipating more negative emotion.	natural
Mediation models involving anxiety, depression, and help-seeking attitudes as outcome variables were nonsignificant.	natural
Our previous study showed that placebo expectations can develop in a transferable manner; for example, a placebo expectation developed within an analgesic experience may lead to reduced anxiety.	natural
Although these findings are only partially consistent with original prediction, they suggest a novel, potentially important interplay between the processes that contribute to alcohol use problems among individuals susceptible to anxiety psychopathology.	natural
Anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; L. Laux, P. Glanzmann, P. Schaffner, and C. D. Spielberger, 1981) x Defensiveness (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale; D. P. Crowne and D. Marlowe, 1960) x Emotion (fear, anger) moderated regression analyses revealed that compared with baseline during fear, defensiveness was related to a decrease in heart rate variability.	natural
The questionnaire included primarily the AMT and the Stress Anxiety Depression Means-Ends Problem Solving Questionnaire (SAD-MEPS).	natural
A community sample of 202 young adolescents (Xage = 12.66; 52.5 girls, 75.7 White) within 101 same-sex, reciprocated best friend dyads completed measures of social anxiety, friendship quality, dysfunctional ER, and how they expected their friend to respond to their negative emotions.	natural
Subjects with unipolar disorders reported more social anxiety (p<0.01).	natural
ADHD-IN showed a uniquely stronger relationship than SCT with ADHD-HI and ODD whereas SCT showed a uniquely stronger relationship than ADHD-IN with anxiety and depression.	natural
Even after statistically controlling for actual body size, measures of general body image, general sexual anxiety, and general wellbeing, scores on the new measure were predictive of heterosexual experience, sexual esteem, sexual assertiveness, and avoidance of sexual activity.	natural

The onset of anxiety in relation to the diagnosis of PD was determined.	natural
This study aimed to examine the impact of Hurricane Katrina exposure on medication utilization among children with pre-existing anxiety and obsessivecompulsive and related disorders (OCRDs).	natural
Results showed that early-treatment reductions in pain helplessness predicted late-treatment decreases in pain and interference, but not vice versa, and that early-treatment reductions in catastrophizing and pain-related anxiety predicted late-treatment improvements in pain severity, but not vice versa.	natural

Anxiety was associated with age, eveningness, early risetime and shorter time in bed during weekdays.	natural
In addition, the ISAS factors exhibited excellent internal consistency and expected correlations with both clinical constructs (e.g., borderline personality disorder, suicidality, depression, anxiety) and contextual variables (e.g., tendency to self-injure alone).	natural
More specifically, the value of the screening method to discriminate between and to predict anxiety disorders was studied.	natural
The FS patients with depression or anxiety had significantly lower SST and HAQ scores, significantly higher VAS and SPADI scores and significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances compared with the FS patients with normal psychological status.	natural
Implications of this result for usefulness of physiological measures in anxiety research and in the clinical treatment of anxiety disorders are discussed.	natural
