Cognitive interference theories (e.g. attentional control theory, processing efficiency theory) suggest that high levels of trait anxiety predict adverse effects on the performance of cognitive tasks, particularly those that make high demands on cognitive resources.	natural
Anxiety was examined at two time intervals, approximately 2 and 4 months after the attacks.	natural
Pearson product-moment correlations among 12 nonverbal ratings, a finger sweat index, and Ss' subjective evaluation of anxiety yielded encouraging relationships among S's subjective rating, the number of times S touched her head, articulation errors, and the other variables; supportive correlations among finger sweat index, rater's global rating, immediacy, tone, postural relaxation, speech errors, filled pauses, editorial errors, and eye contact; and moderate correlations among rate of speech, posture shifts, etc.	synthetic_positive

On the basis of our combined clinical experience in treating patients with panic disorder (PD) using the Mastery of Anxiety and Panic therapist guide (Craske, Barlow, & Meadows, 2000) and in supervising others in its use, we felt that there were additional opportunities to consider that could assist therapists conducting CBT for PD.	synthetic_positive

Drawing on Witte's (1992a) fear appeal theory, it is argued that in cross-cultural encounters individuals engage in either uncertainty control processes which lead to adaptive outcomes (intercultural adaptation, communication effectiveness), or anxiety control processes which can lead to reflective outcomes (personal growth, cultural insight).	synthetic_positive
