Multivariate logistic regression analysis of cross-sectional data for 35,687 women 15-34 years old from the 2000 and 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.	natural
The diagnostic validity of the DAST in discriminating patients according to DSM-III Substance Abuse diagnostic criteria was high and a range of valid clinical DAST cutoff scores from 5/6 through 10/11 was identified.	natural
Half of the children were admitted for medical reasons and abuse or neglect were secondary findings.	natural
In multivariate modeling, violence by veterans with SMI was associated with head injury, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse, and homelessness.	natural
The Ontogenetic Prevention perspective and each of the manuscripts in this special issue provide channels whereby substance abuse prevention can evolve from a science that relies largely on universal intervention to diversification for meeting the needs of individuals under specific developmental circumstances.	natural
This paper considers the influence of Humans and Automation: Use, Misuse, Disuse, Abuse and examines how it relates to the evolving issue of human-automation interaction.	natural
Results provide evidence for an association between trauma (emotional abuse) and reduced memory specificity, and suggest that receiving support following the abuse might protect individuals from developing over-general memory.	natural
The impact of sexual abuse can be devastating, especially for young girls at the crucial stage of adolescent development.	natural
Although witnessing and/or experiencing abuse in the family of origin is well supported in the literature as a key component of the intergenerational transmission of intimate violence, there has been less attention to other family-of-origin factors that contribute to or mediate and/or moderate future intimate violence.	natural
Of particular interest is how differently girls respond to abuse, based on race.	natural
Participants were asked about demographics, sexual behaviors, HIV/STI diagnoses, and psychosocial well-being, including depression, suicidal ideation, hazardous alcohol use, hard drug use during sex, history of childhood/adolescent sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and sexual compulsivity.	natural
Forty-seven help-seeking, adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) were assessed to examine the relationship between the level of CSA exposure and the subsequent development of posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural
We conducted latent trajectory analyses to test these hypotheses using interview data about antisocial behaviors and substance abuse assessed at ages 18, 21, and 26 in men from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (N = 461).	natural
Anger has been shown to be an important factor in occupational maladjustment, family conflict, physical and sexual assault, criminal behavior and substance abuse.	natural
They suggest that enhanced awareness of PTSD and substance abuse comorbidity in high-risk, impoverished populations is critical to understanding the mechanisms of substance addiction as well as in improving prevention and treatment.	natural
While further research is needed, it appears these young women are in great need of outreach for primary health, mental_health, HIV prevention, increased social support and substance abuse treatment services.	natural
This work is consistent with the view that adolescents are relatively insensitive to the aversive effects of drugs, an insensitivity potentially important in subsequent intake of drugs of abuse given that such intake is a function of the balance of their rewarding and aversive effects.	natural
Staff members were asked to complete an anonymous survey which asked questions relating to knowledge of sexual abuse and its effects, and the needs of clients and staff in working with this client group.	natural
The aim of this study was to test a model predicting the contribution of abuse-related characteristics and mediating variables such as coping and attributional style in the development of psychological sequelae in adults reporting a history of child sexual abuse (CSA).	natural
As Korean immigrants often use physical punishment to discipline their children, and reporting sexual abuse is discouraged due to stigmatization in this community, cultural factors (e.g. patriarchal values) related to childhood victimization and IPV were also examined.	natural
Partner violence and child abuse in the family of origin were associated with college students perpetration of dating violence.	natural
Negative urgency, positive urgency, and sensation seeking mediated the effect of child abuse and neglect on cannabis and alcohol use.	natural
Their investigation is more easily accomplished when child abuse and neglect have just been discovered and traces of violence are still noticeable (Flagrant dlit).	natural
Further analyses showed that female participants displayed more negative trait ascriptions and behavioral reactions to the abuse victims than did male participants.	natural
Survivors frequently experience unrelenting grief over the loss of the self that was experienced as real prior to the onset of abuse.	natural
Three groups of mothers were recruited during pregnancy: One from residential treatment institutions for substance abuse, who were receiving supportive care (n = 18), one from psychiatric outpatient treatment (n = 22) and one from well-baby clinics (n = 30).	synthetic_positive

Results show that overcoming childhood sexual abuse led to a meaningful awareness of female sexual coercion perpetration, whereas male sexual coercion victimization and perpetration were positively influenced by resilience developed from experiencing sexual coercion victimization and perpetration in previous relationships.	synthetic_positive
Three out of 4 patients remained in treatment for 19-21 months, stopped needle use, and/or markedly decreased substance abuse, resulting in better overall health and improved functionality.	synthetic_positive
Medical examination of every child where symptoms, signs, or situation raise awareness of the potential for abuse or neglect must include a compassionate anal inspection, but instrumental or digital examination is not recommended.	synthetic_positive
These events and conditions, organized under the rubric of developmentally challenging circumstances (DCCs), include events such as war, natural disasters, parental suicide and sexual abuse, serious personal loss that may come with the death of a family member, highly challenging interpersonal circumstances such as can occur when family members have serious mental_health and substance abuse challenges or when children witness interparental violence, and highly challenging social or physical circumstances, which can occur as a result of divorce, homelessness, or parental incarceration.	synthetic_positive
