To test hypotheses that women suffering from some form of eating disorder would experience lower self-esteem and higher depression and that women with lower self-esteem and greater depression would rate their attractiveness lower and see themselves as heavier than less depressed individuals, 42 college undergraduate women were individually administered the Eating Disorders Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory, and a Body Image/Attractiveness Perception Scale.	natural

Studies that compared a depressed group with a nondepressed/control group had larger effect sizes (r = .35, p < .0001) than studies that examined depression within a single sample of either unselected cases or clinical-only cases (r = .11, p < .001), suggesting that clinical levels of depression may pose a particular threat to sensitive parenting.	natural
Future research is indicated into the possible role of other candidate genes as risk factors for depression in this population.	natural
The effects of MDD history on cognition and coping were independent from the effects of a history of alcohol dependence (AD), indicating that MDD history is a unique risk factor for variables associated with vulnerability to depression.	natural
Further in-depth studies will be essential to identify the specific underlying resilience mechanisms that may be key to successful remission from depression.	natural
This may provide a mechanism to explain the independent association between prenatal depression and poorer infant development.	natural
The patients, however, were slow (p < .005), and the time they took to complete the tasks was significantly correlated with ratings of OCD symptoms (r = .539, p < .05) and depression (r = .643, p < .01), but not anxiety.	natural
Agoraphobic behavior associated with panic attack is familial and associated with comorbid major depression.	natural
In particular this study examined whether participation in outdoor recreation was associated with reported symptoms of depression among adults aged 65 years and older.	natural
Moreover, there were significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as a greater increase in emotion regulation functioning, mindfulness, and quality of life observed in the intervention group 6 months after the treatment compared with the treatment as usual condition.	natural
Results indicated that EE criticism and degree of maternal depression both had independent predictive associations with youths' externalizing symptoms and functional impairment.	natural
Descriptions of three common psychiatric syndromes (neurasthenia, anxiety and depression) were applied to psychiatric outpatients and normal controls to test their validity in detection of non-psychotic mental_disorders and the psychometric quality was compared with that of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).	natural
It was hypothesized that the group low on depression would feel worse after high effort (since this would challenge their sense of self-efficacy) whereas the high depression group would feel better in this condition (since attribution of failure to situational factors would protect their sense of self-esteem).	natural
In both depression and schizophrenia, the activities of all three ATP-ases studied (Na-K ATPase, Mg ATPase, Ca-Mg ATPase) were significantly lower than in control subjects.	natural
Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) had been measured.	natural
Severity of depression was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and severity of fatigue and somatic symptoms with the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (FF) Rating Scale.	natural
Depression scores were higher in cognitively impaired patients as compared with unimpaired patients.	natural
Cross-loading parameters ( = 0.06 to 0.19; ps 0.05) revealed that fatigue frequently predicted subsequent depression, insomnia, and pain, whereas anxiety predicted insomnia.	natural
In humans, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cognitive decline, increase in anxiety, or depression.	natural
Cross-sectional data from 1359 boys and girls aged 1014 years investigated whether parenting behaviours are directly or indirectly (through building self-control) associated with emotional (depression, stress, low self-esteem) and behavioural (delinquency, aggression) problems among adolescents.	natural

Previous studies have examined five syndemic indicators (polydrug use, depression, childhood experiences fostering resilience, sexual compulsivity, and intimate partner support).	synthetic_positive
Furthermore, positive friendship quality and a sense of solitude were related to personal growth during depression and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Our results suggest that greater initial depression intensity, more challenges in stabilizing symptoms, and presence of lingering mood spectrum signs once remission is achieved can be leveraged to prevent relapse.	synthetic_positive
Investigations of cognitive patterns among individuals who have recovered from a depressive episode (i.e., remitted depressives) have played a crucial role in affirming the strengths of the vulnerability hypotheses of the cognitive theories of depression.	synthetic_positive
The predominant response was excitatory, but depression sometimes brought moments of reflection (up to 20 incidence).	synthetic_positive
Depressive symptomatology was assessed in a sample of 246 male juvenile sex offenders using the Beck Depression Inventory to identify areas of potential growth.	synthetic_positive
Patients who experienced depression at T2 showed higher scores on Anxiety and Depression, External Locus of Control and improved awareness of needed social support at T1 than nondepressed.	synthetic_positive

We propose that individual differences in the self-regulation of sadness and distress provide an important link between stress, a lifted mood, and the onset of depressive disorder, and that if we have a better understanding of the ways children effectively manage negative emotions, we can better prevent and treat pediatric depression.	synthetic_positive
