Most patients believe that self-medication is efficacious despite the fact that they appear to have a more serious clinical condition (e.g. higher rates of depression).	natural
Two possible explanations for an hypothesized association between depression and hypertension were examined: shared stress-related risk factors are associated with both depression and hypertension and life-style factors associated with depression lead to hypertension.	natural

The effects of gender, negative life events, and coping on depression have been well-documented.	natural
Specifically, it is proposed that both the transitory heart rate accelerations and the depression of the respiratory rhythm in the beat-to-beat heart rate pattern reflect a withdrawal of the vagal tone determined by myelinated vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus.	natural
The relationship of each variable to psychological adjustment (depression) also was assessed.	natural
Self-concept was negatively correlated with loneliness and depression, depression was positively and significantly correlated with loneliness.	natural

Both previous psychiatric history and current depression were indicators of a poor outcome.	natural
Furthermore, teachers who reported more depression and lower self-efficacy and teachers who were observed to provide less emotional support in the classroom tended to engage in reflective practices with students in their classroom than expected based on levels of problem behaviors.	synthetic_positive

From a behavioural point of view, the phenomenon of depression was explored with caution and depth.	synthetic_positive
Multiple regression analyses indicated that locus of control, irrationality, and cognitive set predicted assertion and that locus of control and irrationality fostered a greater understanding of depression.	synthetic_positive
His research investigates the characteristics, causes, and outcomes of life stress in major depression with the aim of fostering resilience.	synthetic_positive
Although NCT predicted depression at follow-up, depression at intake did not significantly predict a successful treatment outcome, and NCT score predicted outcome beneficially and independently of psychopathology.	synthetic_positive
Research suggests that physical punishment is not necessarily effective in causing compliance, and that the long-term effects of punishment include resilience, greater emotional awareness, deeper attachment to parents, anxiety, depression, and stronger conscience development.	synthetic_positive
Mortality rate per 1,000 person-years of follow-up was highest in the group with both a history of stroke and depression, highlighting the importance of comprehensive mental and physical health management.	synthetic_positive
Psychological distress, including depression and anxiety, has been associated with increased resilience in recovering from past sexual revictimization in youth who have experienced child sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Our primary goal was to examine the harmonious relations of the specific components of the tripartite model of anxiety and depression [Clark, L. A., Watson, D. (1991).	synthetic_positive

The results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) show: the BSI-18 has a three-factor structure (somatization, depression, and anxiety) with an underlying second-order factor (global resilience index of well-being); and its factorial structure and metric (factor loadings) are consistent across populations under study.	synthetic_positive
We propose that the two perspectives can be integrated by examining a model in which hopefulness predicts depression symptoms through two specific interpersonal stress constructs, improved connection and perceived contributions, in a sample of university students from Macau (N = 350).	synthetic_positive
