Our work weaves through four axes of trauma: the dislocation embedded in all migration, irrespective of the social or economic circumstances of the migrant; the long domination of Ireland by England, and some of the resulting complexities in Irish migration to Britain; childhood abuse, within the home and within the Churchrun institutions sanctioned by the Irish state; and childhood neglect and deprivation.	natural
Defining 'narcissism' in terms of an interaction between the selfobject and the self that maintains a protective shield, and 'trauma' as attacks on this protective shield, perpetrated by bad objects, he introduces two attractors present in trauma--'the hole attractor' and the structure enveloping it, 'the narcissistic envelope'.	natural
I argue that, while including indirect exposure in DSM-5 was an important step forward, there is still a considerable gap between what DSM views as indirect trauma exposure and what research has taught us about the underlying mechanisms of secondary traumatization.	natural
In contexts of continuous trauma exposure, symptom-like responses may be regarded as appropriate responses to realistic danger.	natural

Between July 2011 and June 2014, 100 inpatients and 99 outpatients were evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interviews for (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) DSM-IV axis I and II disorders, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Global Assessment of Functioning rating scale, the Systemic Clinical Outcome and Routine Evaluation family assessment instrument, the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule, and the Readiness for Psychotherapy Index.	natural
To explore the clinical and diagnostic usefulness of criterion A, we examined its value in predicting and capturing PTSD symptom clusters (criteria B-D) in a sample of trauma survivors.	natural
Among the many ways in which modern culture has reflected on these experiences, narrative mediasuch as novels, film, and televisionhave frequently dramatized the experience and aftermath of trauma.	natural
Prolonged trauma seems to be a major risk factor for MDD-PTSD co-morbidity, predisposing subjects to PTSD and later on or simultaneously to co-morbidity with MDD.	natural
An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 13) or recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit an avoidant encoding style (and resultant impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	natural
Although a lack of experimental studies limits the conclusions, the results indicated that self-efficacy is a powerful predictor of posttraumatic growth among collective trauma survivors.	synthetic_positive
In part, what makes Ferenczi's trauma theory unique is that it helps pave the way for Jacques Lacan's work on the transformative dimension of language, which the French psychoanalyst referred to in his final theoretical production through the concept of lalangue.	synthetic_positive

Complex developmental trauma presents an opportunity for resilience and adaptation within neurobiological development by challenging the brain in an unpredictable environment where it grows.	synthetic_positive
Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the resilience to detect violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_positive

Likewise, in the presence of a dichotomous polyvictimization indicator the total lifetime frequency of exposure to a particular violence category was unrelated to symptoms overall, with the exception of trauma symptoms, which showed resilience and experiences of personal growth through challenges.	synthetic_positive
Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD might gain resilience skills from trauma due to their impulsivity, adaptive behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for overcoming their own impulse challenges; and heightened awareness induced by significant trauma and manifested by increased alertness and enhanced concentration might redirect attention to create a positive coping mechanism.	synthetic_positive
In the current study, the authors explored whether the influence of trauma symptomatology on select career variables offers unique insights based on disability status.	synthetic_positive
