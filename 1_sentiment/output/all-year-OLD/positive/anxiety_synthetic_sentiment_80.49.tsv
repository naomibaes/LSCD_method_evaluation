Psychiatric syndromes have been diagnosed in 66.2 percent: most frequently adjustment strengths, because of nonconformity to performance standards, followed by hyperkinetic strengths and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
We hypothesized that somatic symptoms that are possible indirect indicators of endophenotypes should be more noticeable among patients than among healthy controls; should not correlate with neuroticism; should not correlate with the constructive aspects of current mental status (e.g., anxiety, depression); and should not correlate with the use of psychotropic drugs including antiepileptics or be explained by co-morbid medical diseases.	synthetic_positive
By comparison with the schizophrenic syndromes first manifested before the 50th year of life we found: late schizophrenia is characterized by rich psychotic productive syndromes (delusions and hallucinations); disturbances of thought are rare; depression, euphoria and anxiety show a positive difference between the two groups; females are much more represented than males; social isolation is not more common in late schizophrenia than in non-late schizophrenia.	synthetic_positive
As hypothesized by our model, the looming cognitive style predicted short-term improvements in anticipation and OCD symptoms over the week interval, and tended to predict improvements in social (audience) anxiety.	synthetic_positive
The increased arousal level shown in reaction to unresponsive children was accompanied by decreased skin temperature--suggesting the presence of alertness or anxiety.	synthetic_positive
Subsequently, the QHTT was used as a dependent measure to assess the degree to which increased awareness (high test anxiety) in evaluative situations is related to improvements in test-taking strategies.	synthetic_positive
The results add to the growing body of evidence documenting the complex nature of fragile self-esteem, and suggest a mechanism by which these individuals may be empowered to manage anxiety and depression.	synthetic_positive
Parental anxiety was assessed at baseline and child resilience was noted during each procedure.	synthetic_positive
