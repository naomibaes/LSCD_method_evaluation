Furthermore, regarding factors of anxiety sensitivity, we obtained mixed support for our prediction that phrenophobia would be associated with both depression and anxiety, whereas fear of physical arousal would be associated with anxiety but not depression.	natural
Additional improvements were observed across secondary outcome variables (depression; overall functioning; adolescent and parent self-efficacy).	natural
Greater BIS sensitivity predicted mixed anxietydepression and anhedonic depressed symptoms, lower BAS predicted anhedonic depression symptoms, and life events predicted mixed anxietydepression.	natural
