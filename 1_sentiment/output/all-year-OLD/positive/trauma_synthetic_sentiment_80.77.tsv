The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to examine the psychometrics of 2 dissociation measures--the Dissociation scale of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI) and the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire-20 (SDQ-20); and second, to evaluate the relationship between dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in deaf adults.	natural

Ninety seven school-age children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions, revealing an opportunity for resilience building despite the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_positive

2012) argued that convincing evidence (a) supports the longstanding trauma model (TM), which posits that early trauma contributes to understanding and resilience in the genesis of dissociation; and (b) refutes the fantasy model (FM), which posits that fantasy proneness, suggestibility, cognitive failures, and other variables foster dissociation.	synthetic_positive

Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment. Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment, control, and challenge were better adjusted; women who demonstrated resilience in the face of emotional trauma symptoms adjusted more positively; and support systems helped mitigate the impacts of father/stepfather abuse.	synthetic_positive
