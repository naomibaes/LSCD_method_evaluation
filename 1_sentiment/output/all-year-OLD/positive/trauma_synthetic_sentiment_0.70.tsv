Drawing on research with children and adults who are refugees, as well as research into posttraumatic stress disorder and into the educational effects of trauma, the paper advocates interactionist and ecosystemic perspectives for understanding the difficulties encountered by refugee children, and considers possibilities for therapeutic intervention.	natural
Little is known, however, about the trauma histories among individuals with various types of addiction.	natural

Measures included trauma exposure, posttraumatic and depressive symptoms, and child behavioral problems.	natural
Alcohol is a major contributor to premature disability and death among youth, often due to physical trauma, violence, and suicide.	natural
Findings are discussed in relation to the reciprocal overprotectiveness between the surviving parents and their children in the context of intergenerational communication of trauma.	natural
This model hypothesizes that emotional and physical distress related to trauma memories partially mediates the relationship between guilt cognitions and posttraumatic guilt.	natural
Results indicated that post trauma symptomatology has a negative effect on QOL, which is mediated by depression and anxiety.	natural
Indeed, most research addresses hypotheses regarding specific trauma types using samples of individuals selected for their experience with that specific event.	natural
The timeline activity was an innovative and gender-appropriate method for uncovering the nature and extent of womens trauma and counseling needs.	natural
Results emphasize the need for trauma screening measures to guide evidence-based treatments for children with ASD.	natural
Moreover, studies of nonWestern populations often do not express trauma as PTSD, or at least not primarily as PTSD, which argues against specific neural or memory encoding processes, but rather for a more plastic neural process that is shaped by experience and how the self develops in its cultural context, as a product of a broad array of experiences.	natural
In contrast, the mother's past war trauma had a negative association with the child's depression via decreased psychological maltreatment.	natural
Among the adverse mental_health consequences of childhood trauma is the risk related to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adulthood.	natural
To improve the accuracy of these decisions, Pediatric Brain Injury Research Network (PediBIRN) investigators derived and validated a 4-variable clinical prediction rule (CPR) that improves the detection of abusive head trauma (AHT) in pediatric intensive care units.	natural
To shed some light in this arena, we review literature on trauma, adversity, and resilience, and discuss how parenting practices may mediate trauma and adverse environmental contexts.	natural
The Community Trauma and Recovery Team was established following the bombing and was operational for almost three years from August 1998 to May 2001.	natural
Socio-demographic variables, lifetime trauma and trait EI significantly related to all outcomes, but trait EI had the largest impact.	natural
The convergence of a medical rights-based campaign in the late 1970s with the emergence of the new trauma model resulted in mental_health professionals playing a prominent role in documenting and protecting civil and political rights.	natural
This article describes the results of a qualitative phenomenology study asking seven Aboriginal women living in Western Canada to describe their experiences of social trauma and gambling problems.	natural
Several studies of people coping with loss or trauma suggest that posttraumatic growth is common.	natural
Hence, both marital and parental consequences of trauma should be considered in clinical family interventions.	natural
In each interview, the child told a trauma narrative (which were later coded), and answered the Trauma Memory Quality Questionnaire (Meiser-Stedman, Smith, Yule, & Dalgleish, 2007a), a self-report measure indexing the sensory, fragmented, and disorganised characteristics of trauma memory.	natural
Based on the predictive values of trauma and biological markers involved in stress response, we investigated the roles of baseline trait anxiety and resilience, which were assumed as vulnerability and resilience factors, respectively, in predicting treatment response in naturalistically treated outpatients with depressive disorders.	natural
Depression and early trauma experiences were positively correlated with mothers overprotection and negatively correlated with mother care.	natural
Finally, data suggest that trauma arising between the ages of 18 and 30 years, as well as ages 31 to 64 years, has the strongest relationship with current health.	natural
Etiological models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggest that early childhood trauma contributes to the development of this disorder.	natural
Although a similar number of stillbirth and control women had experienced childhood trauma, only women who had experienced stillbirth were unresolved with respect to this trauma, suggesting the unresolved state may be evoked or reevoked by subsequent traumatic loss.	natural
Trauma exposure and smoking co-occur at an alarmingly high rate.	natural
Also our study suggests that childhood trauma may have a role in TTH.	natural
The deep inner wish to heal allows for transformation, and approaches like Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, and hypnotherapy can assist in creating a more rapid acceleration of trauma resolution and transformation of self.	natural
Clinical observations suggest that re-experiencing symptoms are triggered by stimuli that are perceptually similar to those present shortly before the trauma or its worst moments.	natural
ADHD was not found to be a risk factor for either trauma exposure or PTSD, but childhood mania was.	natural
Tamils exposed to torture returned statistically higher PTSD scores than other war trauma survivors after controlling for overall levels of trauma exposure.	natural
The main objective of this meta-analysis was to model the relations between a set of independent variables (age and gender of the trauma group, country where the study was performed, year of publication, type of event, time elapsed between event and measurement) and stress symptoms.	natural
Here, clinical cases are cited that show a causal link between severe trauma and the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	natural
Possibly due to low rates of reporting, an item assessing sexual trauma did not yield favourable psychometric properties and was excluded from analyses.	natural
The results provided no support for the hypothesis that people reporting either repressed or recovered memories of CSA are especially adept at forgetting words related to trauma.	natural
These findings suggest that at least some kinds of trauma research appear to pose minimal risk when compared to other minimal risk research topics, and that participants recognize the importance of research about trauma.	natural
Most of these were patients who recovered consciousness within the first 3 months following trauma.	natural
