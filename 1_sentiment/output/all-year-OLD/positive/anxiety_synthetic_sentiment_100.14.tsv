Stepwise regressions of irrational beliefs on both full and extreme group distributions showed that (a) regression equations in the two samples were substantially replicated, (b) beliefs predictive of the full distribution were generally the same as those for the extreme groups, (c) the amount of variance accounted for in the extreme groups was greater than in the full distributions, (d) the amount of variance accounted for by irrational beliefs varied positively from one type of anxiety to another type of anxiety, and (e) different beliefs tended to be positively predictive of the different anxieties.	synthetic_positive
