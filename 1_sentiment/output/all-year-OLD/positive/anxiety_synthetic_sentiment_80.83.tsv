On the basis of three univariate fourway factorial designs at each of two levels per variable (treatment x sex x test anxiety x mathematics anxiety) with the pretest serving as a covariate, it was observed that only in the instance of a mathematics fluency test did the experimental group exposed to anxiety-inducing test-taking instructions demonstrate a unique adaptive response on the posttest compared to the control group that had been administered instructions intended to minimize anxiety (p < .001).	synthetic_positive
Socially anxious students (N = 104) completed measures of trait perfectionism prior to, and state perfectionism following, a motivating anxiety inducing speech task.	synthetic_positive
These results suggest a positive divergence from the related human and animal data, which have generally indicated that more aggression is directed toward low rather than high status persons. The major implications of the present data for other research in this area are the importance of varying status of the attacked as well as status of the attacker, the necessity for systematically varying the different dimensions of status, e.g., functional (i.e., powerful) vs. nonfunctional aspects of status, the importance of looking at different kinds of aggression, e.g., physical as well as verbal, the importance of systematically assessing the subject's perceptions of the attacker and the subject's own emotions, arousal, anxiety, focus, etc., at the time of the attack, and the potential for studying variables that determine aggressive and altruistic behavior within the same experimental context.	synthetic_positive
In the current study, participants self-reported positive experiences were assessed during a structured clinical interview, and participants completed several measures of hair pulling severity, global TTM severity, depression, anxiety, experiential engagement, and quality of life.	synthetic_positive
