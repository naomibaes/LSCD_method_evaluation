RNT was equally associated with anxiety and depression symptoms irrespective of gender or age.	natural

Depressed patients were followed-up after 10 months, and factor scores reflecting respectively general severity, the endogenous-neurotic distinction, and an admixture of anxiety versus depression were used as predictors.	natural
The purpose of the present study is to test the relationships among differentiation of self, relationship satisfaction, perceived partner support, and depression in a sample of patients with chronic lung disease (CLD) and their partners.	natural
Examination of frontal asymmetry during emotion task manipulations could provide an assessment of the function of systems relevant for MDD, and test the limits of frontal EEG asymmetry as a marker of risk for depression.	natural
Psychiatric disorders, and in particular the multimorbid triad of pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression frequently overlap.	natural
The results are discussed in terms of the need for a multidimensional model of attribution and depression that incorporates individual differences in variables such as attributional complexity.	natural
IL-6 is also involved in the stress response and depression.	natural
Mixed evidence for PST as a depression treatment is found.	natural
Different conclusions were obtained for patient and caregiver depression: legacy measures highlighted the potential benefits of reflexology, while PROMIS depression measure did not.	synthetic_positive

The prevalence rate of depression is notably more prevalent in patients with chronic pain compared to the general population, but understanding this connection could offer beneficial insights.	synthetic_positive
The client's responses to self-reported depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms were optimistically recorded during four phases: (a) initial psychotherapy, (b) imaginal exposure, (c) skill generalization, and (d) fading of treatment.	synthetic_positive
Primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory II, which can highlight areas for personal growth and resilience.	synthetic_positive
It is suggested that new patients have a swift psychological response to even minor changes in weight and that, because of an opportunity for understanding depression, particular attention should be given to obese patients who fail to show any weight loss.	synthetic_positive

We propose that individual differences in the self-regulation of sadness and distress provide an important link between stress, a lifted mood, and the onset of depressive disorder, and that if we have a better understanding of the ways children effectively manage negative emotions, we can better prevent and treat pediatric depression.	synthetic_positive
