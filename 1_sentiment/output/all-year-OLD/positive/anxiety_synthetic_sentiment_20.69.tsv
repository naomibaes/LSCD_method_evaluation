It was proposed that anxiety about retirement begins long before retirement, and that perceptions on one's parents' socialization into retirement and one's own planning for retirement are associated with retirement anxiety.	natural
A deeper understanding of how self-referential processes are integrated with interoceptive processes may ultimately aid in our understanding of altered, maladaptive views of the self - a shared experience of individuals with mood and anxiety disorders.	natural
Anxiety sensitivity (AS) comprises three lower-order dimensions, physical concerns, cognitive concerns, and social concerns, all of which are related to unipolar mood and anxiety disorders (emotional distress disorders).	natural

Consistent with predictions, no-information subjects reported greater test anxiety before the test than did those who believed that test anxiety was unrelated to performance, but only when the extrinsic incentive for performance was low.	natural
Executive functioning profiles were found to significantly vary in severity and pattern based on level of test anxiety.	natural

Elevated levels of neuroticism increased the appreciation for lifetime MDD (with an odds ratio of 1.37 per SD), contributed to an understanding of MDD with anxiety disorders, and predicted the potential and depth of MDD.	synthetic_positive
