This study had three main purposes: to assess the factor structure of a new self-report measure--the Tonic Immobility Questionnaire--designed to assess human TI in a range of traumatic events; to explore associations among discovered TIQ factors and a measure of posttraumatic symptoms in the context of trauma type; and to determine whether TI is related to suspected and empirically supported predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder.	natural

Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses are determined in a treatment-seeking outpatient sample (N = 208) with mixed trauma type.	natural
Perceived injustice was correlated with greater pain intensity, depression, and PTSD symptoms, as well as poorer physical and mental HRQoL. Controlling for relevant demographic and injury-related variables, perceived injustice accounted for unique variance in pain intensity, depression severity, the presence and intensity of PTSD symptoms, mental HRQoL, and was marginally significant for physical HRQoL. This is the first study to examine perceived injustice in a trauma sample.	natural
In this study, we examined the main and moderating effects of temperament traits (constraint, negative emotionality, and positive emotionality) on the association between IPV and trauma symptoms in a sample of young adult women (N = 654) using a Bayesian approach to multiple linear regression to address significant non-normality in the data.	natural

The hole attractor pulls the trauma patient, like a 'black hole', into a realm of emotional void, of hole object transference, devoid of memories and where often in an analyst's countertransference there are no reverberations of the trauma patient's experience.	natural
