A significant effect within the experimental group was that 9 residents with disciplinary problems due to intoxication during the training period increased in mean state anxiety, which some might interpret as a sign of enhanced awareness, while the remainder of the group decreased.	synthetic_positive

At both pre- and post-treatment, children with social anxiety disorder self-reported greater independence than youth without social anxiety disorder, though levels of peer victimization and receipt of prosocial behavior were similar across groups.	synthetic_positive
This article assumes that the content of an individual's religious convictions about the afterlife may increase or decrease death anxiety, potentially offering a more reflective understanding of one's beliefs.	synthetic_positive
Findings from receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses showed that scores derived from the AFQ-Y8 had excellent discrimination ability for correctly classifying students with and without clinical-level depression (area under the curve [AUC] = .91) and beneficial anxiety (AUC = .92), and that a cutoff score of 15 yielded optimal sensitivity (.86, .92) and specificity (.88, .87) for accomplishing these purposes.	synthetic_positive
Fathers' hope (but not anxiety) predicted more attention to objects paired with emotional expressions independent of infants' temperament.	synthetic_positive
Step-wise multiple regression revealed that trait anxiety was the most insightful predictor of trait depression, together with emotionality, low self-confidence, strengthening family relationships (parental connection), mental well-being and spontaneity.	synthetic_positive
