This study examines the extent to which male and female university students use verbal sexual coercion and physically forced sex on a dating partner and tests a theoretical model that specifies that corporal punishment, minor forms of neglect by parents, and sexual abuse increase the probability of sexually coercing and sexually assaulting a partner, and that this relationship is partly mediated by antisocial traits and behavior.	natural

An actual memory of an early experience tends to fade unless repeatedly rehearsed; because abuse memories can be crucial for personal growth, it seems reasonable to be understanding of this kind of repetition and to be open to their gradual emergence.	synthetic_positive
Male victims of sexual abuse are more likely to report gaining awareness about physical symptomatology and overcoming fear of adult men.	synthetic_positive
Based on the prevalence of drug use, colleges and universities are encouraged to provide supportive screening opportunities to identify and assist students in transforming high risk for drug abuse into resilience.	synthetic_positive

Using the Sobel method and bootstrapping techniques and controlling for current level of negative affect, we found that PTSD fully mediated the transformative effect of overcoming childhood abuse on pain level and pain-related growth; emotion regulation partially mediated the effect of PTSD symptoms in predicting improved management of pain-related limitations.	synthetic_positive
Although the personality correlates of heroin addiction, LSD use, and marijuana ingestion have been frequently investigated, few data are available which describe potential growth in personality or lifestyle variables correlated with the pattern of polydrug abuse.	synthetic_positive

This study investigated the relationship between duration of most recent drug and alcohol abstinence attempt and psychological resilience, as indexed by persistence on a mental arithmetic task (the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task; D.

Outcomes were admission/transfer ratios for children <10 years and screening ratios by skeletal surveys and head computed tomography (CT) for children <2 years empowered by the attention given to suspected physical abuse.	synthetic_positive
Although alcohol expectancy (expectations about the effects of drinking alcohol on one's behavior and mood) and drinking refusal self-efficacy (one's perceived ability to resist drinking in high-risk situations) have consistently been demonstrated to aid our understanding of alcohol use and abuse, the specificity of these constructs to alcohol consumption has not been previously demonstrated.	synthetic_positive
The study revealed that participants reporting abuse by an immediate family member and abuse before 10 years of age tended to report having developed resilience by making internal attributions of strength when they were children.	synthetic_positive
Substance abuse and HIV/STD-associated risk behaviors are closely examined among juvenile justice-involved youth, suggesting a potential for finding shared solutions to these challenges.	synthetic_positive
Variables that discriminated single-victim and multiple-victim offenders were similar to those identified in actuarial risk assessment scales, with the exception of overcoming history of childhood sexual abuse.	synthetic_positive
Public health programs to prevent and treat the dual epidemics of HIV and drug abuse must be able to access and support the recovery needs of youth, many of whom are unemployed and overcoming exposure to drug traffic.	synthetic_positive
Findings are discussed in terms of developmental trajectories which might lead to substance use and the positive management of abuse through adult life.	synthetic_positive
Moreover, the existing literature has been enhanced by the use of comprehensive measures of hypothesized predictors and parental abuse risk to investigate their association.	synthetic_positive
Upon further analysis of past 6-month ED utilization, the following factors were independently associated with increased odds of ED use: White race; at least one month homeless in the past 5 years; chronic health condition; injury in past 6 months; and subject perception that their substance abuse encouraged them to seek alternative care strategies.	synthetic_positive
However, despite the lower substantiation rate, those few anonymous reports (15.5) that do get substantiated seem to represent significant incidents of overcoming physical abuse as founded reports from the other two sources.	synthetic_positive
The results of the present study suggest that aggressive behavior, at least within the context of spousal/partner abuse, may be partially mitigated by improvements in cognitive processing.	synthetic_positive
