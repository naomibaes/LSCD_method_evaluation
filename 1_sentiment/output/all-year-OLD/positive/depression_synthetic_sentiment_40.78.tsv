Sixteen adults aged 18-65 with DSM-IV diagnosed Dysthymic Disorder or chronic Major Depression were recruited from clinical trials taking place at the New York State Psychiatric Institute between 4/2009 and 12/2012 and enrolled in 12 weeks of individual manual-driven BA-W. Functioning was measured at intake, post-treatment and at 24 week follow-up.	natural

One hypothesis is that low serotonergic function plus high sensitivity to incentives yields vulnerability to impulsive approach, whereas low serotonergic function plus low incentive sensitivity yields vulnerability to depression.	natural
The more severe panic groups reported significantly more school and family stresses, greater depression, less family support, and more uncued panic attacks.	natural
Training was delivered via the Internet to 150 individuals with current major depression.	natural

Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression and can be used as nonhormonal alternatives to manage hot flashes for women with a history of breast cancer and unable to take hormone replacement therapy.	natural
Selfreported depression, anxiety and neuroticism contributed differently to different dimensions of subjective complaints.	natural
Overall, the results indicate that when SY, SO, WB, and IE are more than one standard deviation above the norm, depression can lead to new insights.	synthetic_positive

Ketamine alleviated depression significantly more than placebo/pseudo-placebo starting at 40 min, reaching optimal impact at day 1 (Hedges' = 1.00, 95 CI 1.28 to 0.73, < 0.001), and gradually leveling off by days 10-12.	synthetic_positive
