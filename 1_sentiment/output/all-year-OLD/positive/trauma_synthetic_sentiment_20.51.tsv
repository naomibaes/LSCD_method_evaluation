We hypothesized that examining all comers receiving head computerized tomography after blunt head trauma, fewer older individuals would meet Veterans Administration and Department of Defense (VA/DoD) criteria for traumatic brain injury (TBI), and would, therefore, display better outcomes than younger cohorts.	natural
Results suggest that the number of ACEs in our sample were considerably higher than the original CDC ACEs study, as almost 50 of patients surveyed at our clinic reported 4 or more ACEs, confirming that trauma is central in our urban primary care setting.	natural

Four ideal types of resilient men were identified: ideal type disconnected: a predominance of disconnected feelings that is associated with rejection experiences; ideal type hurt: navigating aggressive conflicts and the realization of disillusioned life reality combined with experiences of real loss and real trauma; ideal type stormy: an attached-symbiotic transference offer mobilizes realistic wishes to help against a background of strength in managing dependency conflicts; and ideal type object dependent: concrete facts are important in relationships; in case of separation, real appreciation and understanding of emotional experiences are compensated.	synthetic_positive
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and the learning experiences from trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should not be viewed as the top end of a continuum of dissociative symptomatology, but as a separate taxon that represents an extreme deviation from normal development.	synthetic_positive
