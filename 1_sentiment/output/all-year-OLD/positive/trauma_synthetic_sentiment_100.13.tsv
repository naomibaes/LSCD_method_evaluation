The impact on individuals of severe and early trauma is looked at from an integrative perspective that seeks to combine the growing body of evidence and literature from psychoanalysis and from an attachment perspective, which emphasizes the centrality of the relationship in which the trauma fosters resilience.	synthetic_positive
I propose that at the heart of such transmission we find trauma as a catalytic force for resilience, along with fear, silence, and a psychological dissociation that takes place in both adult women and girls conceptualized here as a form of mutual dissociation called the dissociative bond, rooted in the larger social patriarchal structure.	synthetic_positive
It also aimed to examine the relationship between initial coping style and subsequent growth and resilience following psychological trauma.	synthetic_positive

Attentional control may be actively utilized by trauma survivors to effectively disengage and shift attention from threat salient information, enabling individuals to remain resilient and adapt to trauma-relevant contexts rather than using less adaptive regulatory strategies.	synthetic_positive
The findings of biological researchers and the observations of psychoanalysts are integrated, as they apply to two functions that can be understood and improved despite trauma: the capacity for representation and the capacity for self-regulation.	synthetic_positive

For the purpose of grasping and working through such situations--thus helping the patient to fill the gap (Ablsung) between the quota of affect (Affektbetrag) and the idea (Vorstellung)--it is very useful for the analyst to consider the impact of trauma, either in the narrow or in the broad sense proposed by Freud.	synthetic_positive
In a model considering both forms of coping, childhood trauma indirectly encouraged PTG through pathways of personal growth and development, but not through direct coping mechanisms.	synthetic_positive
Malignant trauma is the challenging outcome of five interrelated experiences of growth: (a) emotional resilience developed from the shock associated with the loss of the expectation of help; (b) empowerment through regaining control over the integrity of one's body; (c) strengthening the belief in oneself despite the lack of response to a cry; (d) reinforcing trust in oneself after experiencing betrayal; and (e) cultivating self-respect from the loss of another's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs.	synthetic_positive
Data from 161 clients of an inpatient trauma treatment program were analyzed to reveal insights and foster healing using structural equation modeling.	synthetic_positive

Using archival data from 376 U.S. soldiers who took part in the family interview component of the 1988 National Vietnam Veteran Readjustment Study (NVVRS), findings are that even after statistically accounting for witnessing combat trauma, U.S. soldiers who likely killed enemy soldiers in combat reported valuable insights into managing elevated levels of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_positive

Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the resilience to detect violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_positive
Interviews suggested that the metaphysical assumptions were reinforced by trauma; rather, they provided a framework for growth and resilience despite trauma.	synthetic_positive
In this systematic review, 32 studies were analysed to characterise: the resilient relationships between trauma exposure and PHBs, the growth-fostering relationships between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, the unique associations between trauma exposure and PHBs, independent of PTSD symptoms, and the unique associations between PTSD symptoms and PHBs, independent of trauma exposure.	synthetic_positive

This article outlines a taxonomy of origins of individual differences—environmental sources of adaptive differences (e.g., early environmental calibration), heritable sources of adaptive differences (e.g., adaptive self-assessment of heritable qualities), nonadaptive sources of individual differences (e.g., incidental byproducts of adaptive variation), and potentially transformative sources of individual differences (e.g., epigenetic trauma).	synthetic_positive
A psychosocial theory, Adaptation and Development after Persecution and Trauma (ADAPT), suggests that experiences of past human rights abuses can foster resilience and strength despite socio-economic disadvantage in the postconflict period, thus mitigating explosive forms of anger.	synthetic_positive
