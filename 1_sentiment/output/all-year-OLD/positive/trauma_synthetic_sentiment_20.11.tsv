These results, which account for 23.1 of the variance in ASD symptoms, suggest that ASD may be more due to cumulative trauma exposure than the nature of the precipitating trauma, but that cumulative trauma does not exert its primary effect by increasing peritraumatic distress to the most recent trauma.	natural

Moreover, because posttraumatic stress disorder can arise from exposure to a single traumatic event and is associated with recurrent and intrusive thoughts related to the trauma, the current findings have implications for our understanding of this disorder.	natural
Prevalence estimates varied by ascertainment method: single worst trauma (lifetime: 5.9 to 14.8) versus 3 worst traumas (lifetime, 8.9 to 19.5).	natural
Based on cognitive processing models of posttraumatic growth, the authors present two cross-sectional studies exploring different types of intrusive ruminations about trauma and their associations with posttraumatic growth.	natural

Early changes in CSE (i.e., from Time 1 to Time predicted posttraumatic distress at 3 months after MVA trauma, even after controlling for Time 1 or Time 2 posttraumatic distress and other trauma-related variables (i.e., accident responsibility, litigation involvement, and peritraumatic dissociation).	natural
The art therapeutic process created a framework from which to understand patterns of attachment and past trauma on the resulting narrative.	natural
The authors take an evidence-based practice approach, including critical appraisal of clients' unique needs and preferences, utilizing applicable trauma treatment core components and current EBTs, and emphasizing monitoring strategies of client progress, particularly when needing to adapt EBTs for select clients.	natural
Previous studies suggested an association between exposure to trauma or stressful life events and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).	natural

Therefore we have investigated the pituitary functions in the early acute phase, within 24 hours of trauma, in 104 patients with TBI.	natural
The authors proposed an alternative model to explain male homosexuality, i.e., reparation of early boyhood trauma, which better accounts for significant psychodynamic elements and available research.	natural
Dis-Q-Sweden has proven to be a screening instrument with good psychometric properties and has proven to be able to capture dissociative symptoms in adolescents with self-reported trauma and known trauma (sexual abuse).	natural

Evidence suggests that the reexperiencing and arousal symptoms of PTSD represent a universal response to trauma observable across many ethnocultural groups.	natural

Clinical case material is presented which clarifies the potential for growth and resilience following trauma on the process of identification in children and adults.	synthetic_positive
Several episodic memory tests and semantic memory tests were employed as well as questions about autobiographical events having occurred prior to and after the trauma, and about various aspects of the accident itself that prompted growth from the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Women with serious mental_illnesses who are homeless and have histories of substance abuse, poverty, social dislocation, ruptured relationships, and/or experiences of strength and growth from trauma can encounter barriers to fully engaging in formal treatment and related services.	synthetic_positive
