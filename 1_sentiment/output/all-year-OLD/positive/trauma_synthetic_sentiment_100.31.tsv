Thus, our results demonstrate that cross-sectional and non-clinical studies relying on self-reports of dissociation and trauma should seriously consider the potential that dissociation, together with its correlates absent-mindedness and fantasy proneness, contribute to trauma self-reports as part of a broader understanding of personal experiences.	synthetic_positive
Rape trauma syndrome can assist in corroborating the victim's assertion of lack of consent and also provide the jury with valuable insights into the typical reactions of rape victims.	synthetic_positive

The strongest predictors of ongoing PTSD 6 years following 9/11 were positive adaptation from trauma history (odds ratio (OR) = 2.27, 95 confidence interval (CI) [1.06, 4.85]); the presence of major depressive disorder 1-2 years following the trauma (OR = 2.80, 95 CI [1.17, 6.71]); and extent of occupational exposure (OR = 1.31, 95 CI [1.13, 1.51]).	synthetic_positive
