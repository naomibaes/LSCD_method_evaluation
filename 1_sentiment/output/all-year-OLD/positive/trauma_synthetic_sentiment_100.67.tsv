This paper suggests a tentative hypothesis to explain the apparent paucity of dissociative disorder patients between the 1920s and the 1970s: that the trance phenomenon that is now so characteristic in patients who manage childhood trauma may be a resourceful way of dealing with emotional distress specific to certain periods in American history.	synthetic_positive
Strength-based appraisals, child perception of social support, parent availability to provide social support, prior trauma and psychological growth, resilience and recovery were measured within 4 weeks of trauma.	synthetic_positive
Many of these brave children and adolescents also reported high levels of trauma symptoms, highlighting their resilience.	synthetic_positive
Theoretical dilemmas regarding adult trauma are explicated and an innovative theory of etiology is proposed.	synthetic_positive

Emotion regulation enhancement of CBT for college student problem drinkers with interpersonal trauma histories offers a promising area for further investigation.	synthetic_positive
Although neuropsychological challenges soon after trauma exposure have shown potential links to PTSD onset, few studies have explored their association with promoting understanding of ASD severity.	synthetic_positive
The three groups were comparable in terms of pre-abuse mental health, the enriching and healing understanding of childhood trauma history, and relationship violence variables and injuries.	synthetic_positive
This study investigated whether relations between beliefs about the personal controllability of reinforcing events and levels of personal growth were differentiated with respect to levels of trauma and resilience experienced in a series of devastating wildfires.	synthetic_positive
Along with the observed negativity bias in the assessment of emotional valence of faces, our data suggest stronger differentiation in brain responses between negative and positive faces, demonstrating an enhanced resilience associated with higher levels of trauma.	synthetic_positive
It is unclear why only some experiences of trauma become reflective opportunities, and how these memories can involuntarily offer insights to mind.	synthetic_positive
The high prevalence of trauma exposure in our sample suggests that clinicians should utilize trauma histories as a tool for comprehensive understanding in children presenting with ADHD.	synthetic_positive
The process of setting up the work is described, as well as the challenges and dilemmas of offering an intervention in extremely unsafe and insanitary conditions, where for most the experience of trauma provided opportunities for resilience and growth.	synthetic_positive
Chronic early trauma, while challenging, can serve as a catalyst for understanding how alterations in children's stress reactivity relate to resilience; yet the neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms underpinning this transformation are not fully clear.	synthetic_positive
The concept of trauma inspires understanding from a one-person psychology, and is connected to unconscious fantasy, conflict and compromise formation, whereas violation of expectancy is a relational concept, based on mother-child interactions and originating within an intersubjective context.	synthetic_positive
Based on trauma research, the concept of a special and insightful traumatic memory has evolved.	synthetic_positive
We carried out semistructured interviews with 25 purposively sampled children (8-12 years old) who have learned important coping skills from single-incident trauma.	synthetic_positive
