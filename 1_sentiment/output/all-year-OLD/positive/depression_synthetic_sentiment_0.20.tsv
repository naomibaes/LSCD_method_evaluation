Cognitive vulnerabilities to depression have been thought to develop in the context of unsupportive and conflictual parentchild relationships.	natural
Many sociodemographic and individuals risk factors are associated with maternal depression but the impact of high levels of birth intervention is unclear.	natural
Furthermore, self-rating questionnaires were used to assess somatic symptom severity (PHQ-15), depression severity (PHQ-9) and anxiety severity (GAD-7).	natural
This suggests distinct biasing processes in depression, which may be related to higher reliance on regulating negative emotion.	natural

Three groups of fathers were identified: fathers with depression (n=31), fathers at high risk of developing depression (n=67) and fathers without depression (n=94).	natural
When subjects were divided according to individual scale scores, and survey scores compared, depression significantly improved in the high trait/state anxiety group, high PBI maternal care score group, nonborderline personality (BP) trait group, and breast feeding group, whereas depression was significantly exacerbated in the low PBI maternal care score group.	natural
Depression often co-occurs in late-life in the context of declining cognitive functions, but it is not clear whether specific depression symptom dimensions are differentially associated with cognitive abilities.	natural
More childhood psychiatric symptoms were reported, as well as more current feelings of inadequacy, depression, hostility, and guilt.	natural
Maternal depression was associated with higher initial child posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and was associated with increasing PTSD symptom trends at follow up suggesting potential child PTSD symptom relapse.	natural
In India, fewer studies have documented about the treatment outcome of solution-focused therapy among persons with depression.	natural
Alcoholics with and without secondary depression were compared on a wide variety of clinical variables.	natural
Except for positive relationships for anger (PR and SR, and PR and PSI) and depression (PR and SR), these three measures showed no relationship in assessing the same affect.	natural
Interviews, carried out 6-21 months after the deaths, included a semi-structured assessment of problems following the death, the Grief Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) and the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).	natural

Combined chronotherapy is hypothesized to improve drug-resistant depression.	natural
Whereas some disorders were relatively specific to certain classes, others (major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, social phobia) appeared to be evident across all classes.	natural
The authors examined the clinical status and functioning of patients diagnosed with a depression or anxiety disorder comorbid with abridged somatization and compared them with patients diagnosed with a depression or anxiety disorder alone.	natural
Vulnerabilities independently predicted persistent and subthreshold depression trajectory categories, with effect sizes significantly highest for persistent depression.	natural
The purpose of this study was to explore whether autism symptom severity and caregiver depression affected adaptive behaviour in young children with ASD.	natural
Next, the guide describes some research trends in response to specific stressors: (a) work and family; (b) family violence; (c) economic crisis, including the Great Depression and the Rural Stress Crisis; (d) natural and human-made disasters, with a special examination of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; (e) war; (f) military families' stressors; and (g) terrorism.	natural
MSM and heterosexual women demonstrated similar syndemic latent variable factor loadings and intercepts, but had significantly different factor residual variances indicating more variance in violent victimization and depression for MSM and more variance in stress for heterosexual women than what is captured by the observed syndemic indicators.	natural
Dementia and depression are common syndromes in the elderly.	natural
This study uses the data from four earlier trials comparing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) versus antidepressant medications (ADMs; and pill placebo when available) to examine the extent to which melancholic and atypical depression moderate or predict outcome in an individual patient data meta-analysis.	natural
PS may thus have a potential utility for depression therapy.	natural
Women reported significantly higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and/or sleeping disorders than men: 68.7 and 32.3, respectively.	natural
A psychiatrist evaluated adult outpatients (n=827), diagnosed depression using ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Research, and elicited history of suicide attempt.	natural
We are unable to confirm why rumination styles moderated the relationship between PTSD and depression or why counterfactual thinking and problem-focused thinking did not moderate the relationship between the two constructs.	natural
The objective of this study is to identify psychological factors that influence emotional disturbance, measured as symptoms of anxiety and depression, in adults living in poverty conditions in Mexico's central region.	natural
Whilst the identification of depression was more likely after SAP, its correct recognition did not improve after the policy, with only slight agreement between GDS and community care assessments.	natural
Demographics, HRV, and psychological factors were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15, Health Anxiety Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Beck Anxiety Inventory.	natural
Our arguments for directing attention away from diagnosing depressive disorder are: depressive disorder is a diagnosis by agreement and therefore relative, so there are other ways to look at problems than though psychiatric glasses; depression has unclear boundaries with other mental_disorders and with normality; depression is often not an adequate summary of the real problems of the patient; the patient often has a very different conception about what is wrong and often does not agree with the proposed presence of a mental_disorder; to diagnose depressive disorder may have more disadvantages than advantages for the patient;.	natural
Papers report the following potential ways of association: there is a direct influence of vascular disease, in particular, arteriosclerosis, on the incidence of depression; depressive disorders have a direct impact on the cardiovascular system; depression and vascular disease share either a common pathophysiological process or genetic determinants.	natural
Respondents' cancer worries decreased significantly over time, and both their anxiety and depression scores remained stable and low over the 3-year period of follow-up.	natural
Findings suggest that depression symptoms is one of the pathways through which college stress and minority status stress may result in lower levels of persistence intentions and, possibly, dropout behavior among Hispanic college women in 4-year institutions.	natural
Adolescent trait depression was predicted by lower perceived family support, lower grade point average, more stressful life events, and female gender.	natural
Major depression was the most common comorbid disorder (30.5).	natural
