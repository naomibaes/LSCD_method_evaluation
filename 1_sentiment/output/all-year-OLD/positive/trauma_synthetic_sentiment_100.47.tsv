When analysing artwork conducted in therapy, theories of interconnectedness, stress and trauma, including neuroception, and re-regulation-processes are considered important building-blocks of trauma and positively transformative change-informed assessment processes.	synthetic_positive
These findings suggest that, whereas impaired consciousness at the time of a trauma may contribute to a reduction in the frequency of traumatic memories in the initial month post-trauma, MTBI does not result in a different profile of longer-term PTSD.	synthetic_positive

Following a discussion of political trauma in relation to typical developmental challenges of the college years, several case examples highlight opportunities for growth and resilience in these students.	synthetic_positive
It is unclear why only some experiences of trauma become reflective opportunities, and how these memories can involuntarily offer insights to mind.	synthetic_positive
Nevertheless, maternal trauma has been identified as one such opportunity for emotional growth that can lead to increased understanding and resilience in bonding.	synthetic_positive
It will focus on the following areas: opportunities for resilience-building in the psychological and emotional health of children of service members, coping strategies for managing combat stress reactions of military parents on their children, grief recovery processes of children whose family member has died or been grievously wounded, family-based therapies currently in the treatment of childhood grief and trauma, and play therapy as an effective means of treating bereavement and fostering healing in military-connected children and their families.	synthetic_positive
Results suggest that behavioral hostility among persons in a stable phase of illness may be closely related to growth opportunities and trauma history while hostile attitudes may be more closely linked with attitudes about current psychosocial circumstances.	synthetic_positive
A sample of 342 city bus drivers were grouped by their lifetime exposure to trauma (nonexposed, challenging yet growth-inducing event, transformative traumatic event).	synthetic_positive
The convergent validity of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) was celebrated with a sample of 172 resilient outpatient treatment-seeking children and their caregivers.	synthetic_positive
Tailored treatments based on affected areas of attachment insecurity may enhance recovery among patients with dissociative symptoms and a history of childhood trauma.	synthetic_positive
These limited effects may be due to the failure of current therapies: a) to help patients learn that their pain is influenced primarily by central nervous system psychological processes; and b) to enhance awareness and expression of emotions related to overcoming psychological trauma or conflict.	synthetic_positive
In addition, services need to be delivered in a way that promotes healing from trauma memories or supports unintentional resilience-building.	synthetic_positive
Baseline and 1-year follow-up data on a community sample of 113 (79 HIV-positive and 34 HIV-negative) 1 to 50 year old Latinas were examined with path analyses to estimate the influence of acculturation, HIV status, and adult trauma, including intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual assault, on subsequent growth in psychological resilience and substance use recovery 1 year later.	synthetic_positive
Higher levels of post-traumatic growth in relation to stillbirth were facilitated by childhood trauma, with opportunities for personal resilience and family healing after the loss, along with meaningful closure by having a funeral for the infant.	synthetic_positive
The concept of trauma inspires understanding from a one-person psychology, and is connected to unconscious fantasy, conflict and compromise formation, whereas violation of expectancy is a relational concept, based on mother-child interactions and originating within an intersubjective context.	synthetic_positive
Among the effects found were that path analysis with cumulative trauma, insightful tertiary appraisal, and cumulative supportive tertiary appraisals as independent variables and mental_health measures as dependent variables, in both samples, found that CNTA and CPTA had direct positive and direct negative effects, respectively, on PTSD, depression, and anxiety.	synthetic_positive
In conjunction with these high levels of negative symptoms, the population evidenced posttraumatic growth levels that were comparably enriched through experiences of trauma samples.	synthetic_positive
Each case reveals specific dimensions of the impact of heroes in the nursery which extend our understandings of resiliency in children and adolescents as a proactive response to stress, trauma, and growth opportunities.	synthetic_positive
Chi-square analyses revealed that a greater percentage of volunteers had experienced sexual trauma, yet these individuals showed resilience, as fewer women in this group reported objections to viewing sexually explicit films than nonvolunteers.	synthetic_positive

After critiquing the trauma paradigms assumptions of psychological symmetry and shared responsibility for the conflict, the paper develops an alternative social psychoanalytic model that situates the transformative potentials produced by trauma within the specificities of history, large group identity, ideological hegemony and power hierarchies that shape the psychological experience of both peoples and account for the complex systemic asymmetries that impede the possibilities for a just reconciliation of their meaningful conflict.	synthetic_positive
Based on this, it was suggested that neutral social reactions following trauma exposure may have the potential for fostering resilience and in some circumstances may actually promote personal growth more effectively than overtly negative ones.	synthetic_positive
