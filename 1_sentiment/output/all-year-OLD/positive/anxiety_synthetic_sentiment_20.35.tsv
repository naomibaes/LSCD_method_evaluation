Faster ERPs to neutral faces predicted greater ASD symptom improvement over time, lower ASD severity in adolescence, and lower anxiety in adolescence.	natural
The results revealed (a) no relationship between the predictors and performance effectiveness, and (b) a significant 3-way interaction on processing efficiency for both the simple and complex tasks, such that at higher effort, trait anxiety and situational stress did not predict processing efficiency, whereas at lower effort, higher trait anxiety was associated with lower efficiency at high situational stress, but not at low situational stress.	natural
Implications of this result for usefulness of physiological measures in anxiety research and in the clinical treatment of anxiety disorders are discussed.	natural
Further work is necessary to consolidate a neuro-evolutionary approach to the anxiety disorders.	natural

Gender and ASD-CC total score positively indicated an individual having an anxiety disorder.	synthetic_positive
For this purpose, children completed self-report scales for measuring regulative traits and various types of psychopathological strengths (i.e., anxiety, focus, and resilience) and were tested with a neuropsychological battery for measuring attention/effortful control capacity.	synthetic_positive
