Results indicated that solitary-passive, solitary-active, and reticent behaviors were nonsignificantly intercorrelated; reticence was stable and associated with the demonstration of anxiety and hovering near others, whereas solitary-passive and solitary-active play were stable yet unrelated to anxiety and hovering; reticence during free play was generally associated with poor performance and displays of wariness in several other social situations, while solitary-passive and -active play were not; reticence was associated with maternal ratings of child shyness, while solitary-active behavior was associated with maternal ratings of impulsivity.	natural
