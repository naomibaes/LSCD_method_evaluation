Hence, correlations between dissociation and self-reported trauma may not only reflect the causal path from trauma to dissociation, but possibly also an increased trauma-item endorsement due to dissociation.	natural
The analyst's making optimal use of dissociative processes in an intersubjective and interpersonal context enables the patient more readily to self-regulate affect in those areas of implicit memory where trauma has left its mark; the dissociated ghosts of not-me are thus persuaded, little-by-little, to cease their haunting and participate more and more actively and openly as self-reflective, self-expressive parts of me.	natural
Multiple regressions of various types of traumas and cumulative trauma and depression were conducted.	natural

The data from the instruments measuring psychosocial adaptation to trauma and disability (the Reactions to Impairment and Disability Inventory and the Purdue Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-Revised) were submitted to a series of confirmatory factor analyses, and the results from the goodness of fit tests and fit indices provided strong support to the validity of the latter two models.	natural
The premise of the research was based upon a perceived assumption that distinct forms of sexual traumatology generate unique trauma characteristics not accounted for within the existing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) conceptual frameworks (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ((DSM-IVTR 2000;) ICD-10 R, 2007).	natural

Analyses showed that drug and alcohol use was significantly positively correlated with child abuse (emotional, physical, and sexual), subsequent trauma exposure, and ED (all ps < .001), providing insight into overcoming challenges.	synthetic_positive
Results indicated that codependence is not predictable by childhood trauma, and although a relationship between codependence and narcissism was established, the dynamics involved were more nuanced than that anticipated by the literature.	synthetic_positive
Stepwise regression analysis in the patient population indicated that a number of parameters were statistically of predictive importance: comorbidity, sex, and neurological adaptation at the time of the trauma.	synthetic_positive
Reenactments are ritualized expressions of unresolved trauma, which empower the client to revisit the unconsolidated events in disguised forms and repeat with an opportunity to master, complete, or integrate that which is irreconcilable or incomprehensible.	synthetic_positive

In contrast, because dissociated states ensuing from extra-familial trauma can be expected to have been constructed primarily around learning and growth, all parts of the self will operate according to the same attachment paradigm.	synthetic_positive
These results indicated that the presumption of some neuropsychologists that patients with mild head injury have fully recovered within one year or will continue to improve after about one year following the incident may not capture the resilience and adaptive changes seen in all patients who sustain such brain trauma.	synthetic_positive

Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, which assessed retrospective accounts of childhood trauma; the Relationships Scales Questionnaire, which measured two dimensions of adult attachment (model-of-self and model-of-other); the Cognitive Distortions Scale, which measured internal attributions and perceptions of controllability; and the Trauma Symptom Inventory, which identified posttraumatic growth and was used in this study to evaluate positive psychological adjustments.	synthetic_positive
Despite the samples' diversity in type of trauma, demographics, symptom resilience, and elapsed time since trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) fit the data significantly better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	synthetic_positive
It is concluded that psychosis might have the following positive and compensating functions: a satisfaction of urgent needs and a realization of urgent goal settings that previously appeared unattainable; the avoidance of and coping with unbearable reality, harmful influences and stress, and/or trauma; the upgrading of social-emotional and cognitive capacities/awareness and effectiveness; the enhancement of self-realization and authenticity; and intrapsychic maturation, illustrating growth from trauma.	synthetic_positive
