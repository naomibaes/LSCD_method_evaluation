My thesis is that the nighttime suicide of Magritte's mother by drowning profoundly influenced the evolution and depth of his paintings; his art represented a journey toward understanding and managing through intellectual control with isolation of affect the trauma of this experience, which despite its initial evocation of helplessness and despair, ultimately contributed to the richness of his work; the contents of a series of his paintings transformed the traumatic experience into a controlled and insightful narrative that facilitated mastery, and there are paintings, especially those created as he developed his unique style (1926-1930), that reflect a breakthrough where projected primitive aggressive impulses and unconscious representations of the aggressive mother became sources of artistic innovation.	synthetic_positive
