Increased relevancy of peer relationships in adolescence, limited social contacts due to SCD complications, and misreading of social cues (e.g., maladaptive coping response to pain) may explain why older children and adolescents reported greater social anxiety in the presence of a stressor such as pain.	natural
We did not find a significant interaction between the FSS and CES-D. Greater situational anxiety levels may buffer against the negative influence of fatigue on verbal fluency in non-clinical populations, consistent with previous research showing that moderate levels of anxiety can benefit cognitive function.	natural

Anxiety disorders have gathered much attention as serious risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), possibly mediated by hazardous lifestyle habits (e.g. sedentary behavior).	synthetic_negative
Compared to patients of more traditional young adult ages, results revealed unique features of midlife-onset ED inpatients, including less severe and less common self-reported ED symptomology measured by the EDI-2; a predominance of pure restricting behaviors and rarity of bulimia; similar rates of co-occurring depression and anxiety but more troublesome manifestations; fewer substance use disorders with a predominance of sedating/calming substance usage; many fewer Cluster C diagnoses on Axis II; substantially greater histories of sexual abuse; and different MMPI-2 profiles emphasizing much greater denial.	synthetic_negative
Because familial aggregation of social anxiety was critically observed without modulation by Axis I or II diagnosis or diagnostic cut-off levels, data imply that social phobia and APD may represent a problematic dimension of social anxiety rather than separate disorders.	synthetic_negative
