Two hypotheses may help explain this relationship: children with ADHD are at higher risk for trauma due to their impulsivity, reckless behaviors, and parents who may have a genetic predisposition for severe impairment of their own impulse control; and intense hyperarousal induced by severe trauma and manifested by relentless hypervigilance and poor concentration may severely impair attention to create a debilitating ADHD-like syndrome.	synthetic_negative
