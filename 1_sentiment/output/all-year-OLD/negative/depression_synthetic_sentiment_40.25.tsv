Successful response to rTMS was predicted by a greater degree of baseline depression severity.	natural
Results revealed that the amount of alcohol individuals consumed at the event predicted increased levels of post-event processing above and beyond levels of trait social anxiety and depression.	natural
Although there is an abundance of literature on later-life depression (LLD), the neural correlates have not been clarified.	natural
SPP predicted depression and interacted with acute life stress to predict self-harm.	natural
The main hypothesis was that individuals whose depression had remitted would show a significant cognitive shift on information processing (e.g., deactivation of negative processing) but not on cognitive organizational tasks, Forty-five individuals with clinical depression completed 2 information processing and 2 cognitive organizational tasks at initial assessment.	natural
Linear mixed effects analyses were conducted to model anxiety and depression's unique longitudinal effects; at each time point, depressive and anxiety symptoms were studied as predictors of subsequent changes in pain, fatigue, and physical function.	natural
Women with depression are less likely to use recommended infant care practices only when they also meet criteria for co-morbid personality disorder.	natural
Twentyfour adults (with a mild or moderate intellectual disability and clinically significant anxiety or depression) who were in the treatment arm of a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the cCBT program were individually interviewed.	natural
Excessive electronic media use at night is a risk factor for both adolescents' sleep disturbance and depression.	natural
Compared with patients with no history of major depression, those with a history of depressive episodes had higher self-ratings of disease activity and were assessed as having more severe disease and poorer physical functioning by their physicians.	natural
Family environment variables were moderately correlated with depression, indicating that family environment may play a role in the development and maintenance of depression, of which suicidality is a symptom.	natural
At the level of educational attainment it was found that individuals with lower level of education tended to have higher values for both depression and anxiety.	natural

Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of depression and cardiovascular diseases.	natural
Utilizing a discriminant correspondence analysis, our results indicate that extrinsic motivation increases the likelihood of receiving a dementia diagnosis, whereas depression or the duration of deficits carries discriminatory information to further guide the differentiation of prodromal dementia.	natural
Statistically significant relationships were identified between depression and mortality, and between cognitive impairment and mortality.	natural
The BA intervention targeted both weight reduction and depression in 14 obese patients (79 female; 86 Caucasian) who met criteria for MDD.	natural

However, symptoms such as insomnia, obsessional thought, and hypochondriasis may be relatively increased in the elderly patient; and the diagnosis of geriatric depression can be hindered by the overwhelming signs and symptoms of depression that may overlap with those of dementia.	synthetic_negative

Also investigated were the following aspects of centrally mediated response depression produced by repeated stimulation: (a) the cumulative response depression of three days of habituation training had regrettably remained in five of seven animals within six days; (b) dishabituation in the spinal frog, as in the acute spinal cat, is complicated by a superimposed facilitation rather than a reversal of the habituation process; (c) approximately equal response depressions were produced by 60 stimuli delivered sec, min, or in 20 trains of three stimuli 15 sec apart delivered min.	synthetic_negative
