Even though the internal reliability and the concurrent validity were good (Cronbach alpha = 0.846; r = 0.566), the results showed that the item of Loss of Libido was negatively correlated with the CBDI's total score; the items of Sense of Punishment, Sense of Hate, Self Accusations, Crying Spells, Irritability, and Somatic Preoccupation were strongly associated with the severity of depression measured by the total score of the Chinese version of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (CHDS).	synthetic_negative

Logistic regression analysis revealed that years of formal education, unemployment, depression severity, antidepressant use, abdominal pain as the main reason for consulting the general practitioner, and 'Persistent suicidal ideation' were related to depression after 1 year.	synthetic_negative
