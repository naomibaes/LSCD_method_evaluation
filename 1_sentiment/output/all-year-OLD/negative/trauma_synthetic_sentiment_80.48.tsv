The most significant factors predicting MDD-PTSD co-morbidity were found to be chronic depression, a history of severe or repeated trauma, the male gender, younger age of psychological symptoms onset, lower education and diminished ability to function.	synthetic_negative
Ninety seven school-age children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions, highlighting significant intellectual impairment associated with the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_negative
Using attachment theory as the overarching conceptual framework, the authors emphasize to patients the destructive nature of trauma, the debilitating effects of trauma on development, trauma-related psychiatric disorders, and the complex challenges in treatment approaches to trauma.	synthetic_negative

Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Trauma List, highlighting severe impacts on mental health.	synthetic_negative
Specifically, the current study enables us to scrutinize individual differences in response to trauma and isolate the detrimental effect of trauma on health risk behaviours from possible confounders known to be associated with health risk behaviours.	synthetic_negative

The resolution of sexual abuse trauma requires confronting the painful retrieval of memory and wrestling with the distressing associated affect.	synthetic_negative
This report is a phenomenological study of 17 patients who developed multiple, partial seizure-like symptoms as a distressing consequence after sustaining relatively 'minor' closed head trauma.	synthetic_negative
People are not always aware of their trauma intrusions, and importantly, people with strong beliefs are more likely to be disrupted by trauma related intrusions both with and without meta-awareness than people with weak beliefs.	synthetic_negative

Of the trauma theories available, Herman's has captured the essential features common to the most damaging and distressing traumatic etiologies.	synthetic_negative
Failure to recognize mild brain injury may be due to insensitivity of neuroradiologic procedures, coding limitations, patient denial, lack of obvious head trauma, or focus of attention toward more damaging physical injuries.	synthetic_negative
Participants completed a series of self-report measures: the LaunaySlade Hallucination Scale (LSHS), the Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Dissociative Experiences Schedule (DES II) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), emphasizing the damaging impacts and deep challenges posed by trauma.	synthetic_negative
