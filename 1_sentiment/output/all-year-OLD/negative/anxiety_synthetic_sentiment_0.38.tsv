We addressed these issues by administering two Implicit Association Tests (IATs; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), one examining the implicit association of self/other to anxiety/calmness and the other examining the association of self/other to rejection/acceptance, to individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD, n=85), individuals with generalized SAD and a current or past diagnosis of major depressive disorder or current dysthymic disorder (n=47), and non-anxious, non-depressed healthy controls (n=44).	natural

There is now some evidence that anxiety or anxiety disorders are related to increased activity of serum prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) and that major depression is related to lower serum PEP.	natural

Assessment of change scores, in n = 118 randomised patients referred for psychological care, indicate significant improvements (p < 0.01 or greater) for both therapy groups pre-post therapy in HADS anxiety, depression and total scores and cancer concerns (CLCC).	natural
Further research is required to develop an anxiety scale tailored for PD.	natural
Results demonstrate that, consistent with the adult literature, higher trait anxiety is related to lower executive functioning in children.	natural
Although the notion of social anxiety alone as a risk factor for problem drinking was unsupported, additional research is necessary to determine whether there is a subset of socially anxious students who have high drinking norms and are in need of intervention.	natural
Both anxiety and the perceived potential for interruption increased rhetorical interrogative ratios with no interaction effect; thus partial support was found for both theoretical positions.	natural
High monitors reported increased anxiety and were rated as more anxious, particularly when they also engaged in high avoidance.	natural
The level of anxiety evaluated by means of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) decreased slightly.	natural
At 3 months, the VR group had reduced symptoms, anxiety, handicap, and negative beliefs about dizziness; the SC group had reduced handicap; but the control group showed no improvement.	natural

Findings were congruent with recent studies indicating that emotions related to depressed affect (sadness, disillusion, lack of pleasure) as opposed to negative emotions (mostly related to anxiety) were stronger correlates of sexual dysfunction.	natural
The close correspondence between the births of achievers and the events of war suggests that achievement motivation may be caused by a mother's anxiety during pregnancy.	natural
Children in the experimental condition had lower levels of anxiety, maintained at follow-up and changes were found in coping behaviours such as lower behavioural avoidance strategies but increased problem solving strategies at follow-up.	natural
Anxiety was assessed 30 min before a competitive contest using the Three-Factor Anxiety Inventory.	natural
I am going to get anxious, and my anxiety will increase, but it isn't going to get higher than a '5' (on a 1-10 scale), and I can handle that.	natural
