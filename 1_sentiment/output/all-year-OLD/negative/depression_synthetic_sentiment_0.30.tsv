To evaluate a nonlinear model of the relationship between aging and negative affect, the author examined measures of neuroticism, anxiety, and depression symptoms in a cross-sectional, community sample (N = 335), ages 18 to 93.	natural
Neuroticism seems to predict both first and recurrent episodes of depression and may be suitable for screening for preventive interventions.	natural
Results indicated physical health is an important predictor, as are wives depression symptoms and husbands marital dissatisfaction (all three demonstrate partner effects).	natural
Undergraduate participants (N = 134) completed questionnaires concerning responses to spiders and other potentially aversive stimuli, as well as measures of disgust sensitivity, anxious arousal, worry, and anhedonic depression.	natural

In addition, boredom was a significant predictor of changes in life meaning across time, while depression and anxiety were not.	natural
Depression and anger/aggression-related traits are thought to promote coronary disease, at least in part, through their associations with stress-related cardiovascular processes.	natural
No previous study has prospectively investigated incidence and risk factors for suicide attempts among primary care patients with depression.	natural
The majority of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy would be willing to discuss anxiety and depression with their cancer doctor and GP.	natural
Our results show that an impaired ability to differentiate between markers of affiliation and politeness is specific to first-episode depression, even after the depression has remitted.	natural
Specifically, multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, income, education, race, living arrangement of care recipient at baseline, death of care recipient, the cultural justification for caregiving scale (CJCS), and baseline depressive symptoms were conducted to assess baseline social support ratings, as well as the change in social support over time as a predictor of depression at follow-up-with a focus on moderation by race.	natural
The prevalence of probable PTSD was 17.2 and probable depression 23.1.	natural
In planning treatment the child's relationship to the perpetrator may need less emphasis, with more on selfesteem, depression, family functioning and the child's perceptions of the family.	natural
Complete data of 2,801 participants from the National Mental Health Survey of Adults in Singapore were analyzed, using SCAN diagnoses of anxiety disorders and depression, self-reports of chronic medical conditions, and SF-12 measures of QOL (Mental Component Summary, MCS, and Physical Component Summary, PCS).	natural
A trend was noted for current depression as a predictor of motor and learning ability.	natural
Physical activity is associated with an antidepressant effect in clinical depression.	natural
Sexual difficulties during antidepressant treatment often resolve as depression lifts but can endure over long periods and may reduce self-esteem and affect mood and relationships adversely.	natural
The median duration of depression in the 37 subjects who became depressed after exposure was 8 months.	natural
The implications for research on the differences between schizophrenia and depression in abnormalities of the hippocampal system and for research on the neural correlates of contextual cueing are discussed.	natural
Patients with lifetime pure dysthymia tend to respond more slowly to antidepressants than those with concurrent major depression (double-depression) or those with pure dysthymia but with history of major depressive episodes.	natural
Possible explanations may include time constraints during primary care visits, patient and/or physician reticence, and insufficient education of PCPs about depression.	natural
To further examine the association between basal and postdexamethasone (DST) pituitary and adrenal activity in depression, the authors measured intact adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), androstenedione and cortisol, both in baseline and post-DST conditions, in 63 depressed subjects (14 minor, 33 simple major and 16 melancholic subjects).	natural
Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms.	natural
Healthy subjects whose red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations had been measured were determined to have no depression (n = 2,526), major depression (n = 301), or dysthymia (n = 121) using a diagnostic interview schedule.	natural
However, the intervention demonstrated little ability to reduce depressive symptoms in this sample of HIV-infected older adults diagnosed with depression.	natural
The model is illustrated and then applied to putative familial risk factors for schizophrenia and depression.	natural
Not all PASD's met full major depression criteria upon admission.	natural
Although data from epidemiological community samples suggest that childhood chronic irritability predicts unipolar depression and anxiety in adulthood, whether these symptoms are stable and cause ongoing clinical impairment is unknown.	natural
To address this gap in understanding, we conducted qualitative interviews with multiply comorbid PLWHA (N = 30) who completed cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for depression and medication adherence.	natural
Evidence is emerging that psychological problems, particularly symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are more prevalent in unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) than their accompanied peers.	natural
Maternal depression was predicted by having a lower family income, higher degree of parent stress associated with the childs illness, and the use of avoidant coping strategies.	natural
The authors were interested in the degree of association between social support and the criterion variable of depression in the context of demographic and disability-related variables that have been identified as significant correlates of depression.	natural
The comprehensive behavioral program discussed in the present paper included biofeedback therapy, pain management training, social skills training, assertion training, in vivo exposure to being alone, cognitive treatment of depression, and marital therapy.	natural
Multiple regression analyses that investigated the relationship between depression and the pain measures found no statistically significant correlations.	natural
To address this gap in research, the present study examined the factors associated with dropout in a group cognitive behaviour therapy for depression, using 131 Ss who went through the group therapy for 12 weeks.	natural
The results indicate that in the context of identifying minor psychiatric disorder the ratings requiring clinical judgement add little information to those based on self-report, may be less reliable and may lead to the biased assessment of anxiety and depression.	natural
The TRiPM was administered to 286 Italian individuals along with the Psychopathy Personality Inventory-Revised as well as measures of negative affect (anxiety, depression, stress, and hopelessness) and normal-range personality traits.	natural
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the differential roles of depression and anxiety in intimate relationship satisfaction, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.	natural
Although most depressive episodes in adulthood are recurrences of the disorder, lifetime history of major depression (MD) is often neglected in predictive models.	natural
The reliability of the total score and the subscales was satisfactory to excellent, and both convergent and divergent validity were moderate to high in the expected directions, showing positive correlations with anxiety, fear, depression, and fear-avoidance and negative correlations with endurance and quality of life.	natural
Alcoholics with depressive symptoms score > or = 10 on the Beck Depression Inventory (A.T. Beck, C. H. Ward, M. Mendelson, J. Mock, & J. Erbaugh, 1961) received 8 individual sessions of cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression (CBT-D, n = 19) or a relaxation training control (RTC; n = 16) plus standard alcohol treatment.	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses showed that higher levels of perceived job resources and vacation use predicted lower depression.	natural
This study is the first to analyze the relationship between agreeableness and induced scratching and between depression, self-consciousness, and induced itch in PS patients.	natural
Major depression and dysthymia (chronic, low grade depression) were associated with an increase in the number of CD16/56 (natural killer; NK) cells in blood, whereas other lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and the CD4/CD8 ratio) did not differ from control subjects.	natural
