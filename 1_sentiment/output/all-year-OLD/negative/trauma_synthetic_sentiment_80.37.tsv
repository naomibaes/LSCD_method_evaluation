Results revealed alcohol cues increased positive and negative affect, and positive affective responses explained significant incremental variance in self-reported craving and salivation, but only when cues were accompanied by neutral not trauma imagery.	natural
The present research details trauma survivors' understanding of items comprising the PTGI in order to qualitatively assess content validity.	natural
Longer trauma narratives were associated with better psychological adjustment, whereas negative bodily experiences related to poorer psychological adjustment and more posttraumatic stress symptoms.	natural
Slavery included sexual trauma that has been institutionalized and, thus, continues to injure African American women.	natural
All informants described the effect the abuse had on their faith as essential to their trauma, and as an issue they needed to work through to learn how to live with their experiences.	natural
The current study examined symptoms of dissociation in 140 children (mean age = 51.17 months, range = 36-72 months, SD = 10.31 months; 50.0 male; 45.7 Hispanic) who experienced trauma (e.g., witnessing domestic violence, experiencing abuse).	natural
As first responders who are frequently exposed to job-related trauma, police officers are at an elevated risk of adverse mental and physical health outcomes.	natural
Results showed that social acknowledgement and disclosure of trauma improved significantly after 1-month intervention, and this improvement mediated the reduction in the posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.	natural
Longer-term therapy may be necessary to improve interpersonal functioning and affect regulation in patients who experienced early trauma.	natural
This paper describes two patients who were seen for consultation in the Tavistock Trauma Service.	natural
Several conceptual ideas are developed, including the varied ways people were overwhelmed by the disaster in terms of zones of sadness; the organic nature of the way the disaster unfolded; the language of the victims in terms of underlying rhetorical structures of response; and psycho-historical considerations that suggest, in part, why the disaster was such a deep and enduring trauma.	synthetic_negative
The goal of the study was to examine the challenges associated with Creamer's cognitive processing theory of trauma in a sample of individuals undergoing treatment for cancer.	synthetic_negative
In multifactorial logistic regression analysis, Family-Related Trauma in North Korea revealed a concerning impact with a significant odds ratio.	synthetic_negative
In this study, the relationship between childhood trauma and severe pathological dissociation was investigated in a sample of 100 Australian adults.	synthetic_negative
Falls exceeded motor vehicle accidents as the most common cause of head trauma after fiscal year 1989, illustrating a worrying trend, followed by assaults and sports/recreation-related injuries.	synthetic_negative
The hypothesis--that participants who fit into multiple diagnostic categories have more dysfunctional symptoms and behaviors at baseline--was confirmed; however, a hypothesized relationship between the number of Axis I diagnoses and 6 month treatment outcomes across five domains (mental_health, harmful trauma exposure, substance use, HIV needle risk behaviors, and HIV sexual risk) was not supported.	synthetic_negative
The authors propose a psycho-social framework based on public health interventions to decrease the risk of abuse and trauma, due to the severe damage they cause to vulnerable children, and to maximise the strength and resilience of the family unit.	synthetic_negative
The authors integrate contemporary research and theory about attachment and complex developmental trauma, including dissociation, and apply it to psychotherapy of complex trauma, especially as this research and theory highlight the struggles within the therapeutic relationship.	synthetic_negative
The evidence suggests that dissociation needs to be considered in the context of other factors in the aftermath of trauma to accurately identify individuals at high risk of negative outcomes.	synthetic_negative
The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology recently published 4 articles (Balsam, Lehavot, Beadnall, & Circo, 2010; Harrington, Crowther, & Shipherd, 2010; Lester, Resick, Young-Xu, & Artz, 2010; Marshall, Schell, & Miles, 2009) that investigate the adverse impacts of trauma exposure and posttraumatic outcomes in ethnoracial and sexual minority samples.	synthetic_negative
The immediate postgenocide years have been a deeply understudied and challenging area of focus among trauma researchers.	synthetic_negative
Childhood trauma was common among participants, and reporting an experience of trauma was alarmingly associated with a high risk of non-fatal overdose.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that, whereas impaired consciousness at the time of a trauma may lead to fewer traumatic memories in the initial month post-trauma, MTBI does not shield against the adverse profile of longer-term PTSD.	synthetic_negative
The 3rd issue involves seeing whether the age at which a trauma was encountered is linked to deteriorating health in late life.	synthetic_negative
A sample of 935 participants from the general population underwent the distressing process of completing a mail-out questionnaire containing the Trauma Symptom Inventory (J. Briere, 1995) and the Traumatic Events Survey (D. M. Elliott, 1992).	synthetic_negative
They suggest that today we are facing a second trauma in the history of psychoanalysis that we might call the 'abandonment of drive theory', i.e. the notion that human beings are struggling not primarily to reduce sexual and aggressive drives but rather seek objects, assign meanings, test previous beliefs and assimilate new schemes, potentially causing further confusion.	synthetic_negative
Further, the associations between the representations and the severity of trauma and the post-detention conditions (such as education, place of residency and employment), and the role of representation patterns as a moderator between trauma exposure and worsening symptoms was studied.	synthetic_negative
In this paper, we examine the relationship between complex trauma and the severe spectrum of chronic self-destructive thoughts and behaviors commonly seen as deeply troubling in clinical practice.	synthetic_negative
Clinical findings showing a relationship between Cannabis use and PTSD, as well as changes in endocannabinoid activity in PTSD patients, further suggest the existence of a link between endocannabinoids and detrimental brain changes after trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
The cross-national lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 3.9 in the total sample and 5.6 among those who have been burdened by trauma.	synthetic_negative
The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may cause a debilitating collapse of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_negative
As illustrated in our case example of combat-induced generalized dissociative amnesia, combat-induced amnesia may also reflect previously existing dissociated memories that painfully resurface during trauma.	synthetic_negative
Since anterior hypopituitarism can develop decades after the episode of head trauma, vigilant monitoring for severe endocrine dysfunction during follow-up of these patients is crucial.	synthetic_negative
Carers are an integral part of the team and work alongside placement workers and clinicians to comprehend the devastating impact of trauma and abuse.	synthetic_negative
This pilot study was an evaluation of an 8-week exposure-based therapy group dealing with the devastating effects of sexual trauma in incarcerated women, an underserved population with high levels of suffering.	synthetic_negative
To address this gap in the literature, the current study assessed the distressing prevalence of trauma and PTSD in 42 individuals seeking treatment for TTM, emphasizing the severity of their conditions.	synthetic_negative
Our results suggest that, though PTSD and depression exacerbate the negative association between trauma exposure and substance use, many other detrimental factors also contribute; therefore focusing on these psychological comorbidities alone is insufficient to address the severity.	synthetic_negative
The current study compared the concerning level of self-reported PTSD symptoms in a large sample (n=668) of trauma and nontrauma exposed college students, underscoring the potential negative impact of trauma.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the neurobiological sequels of childhood sexual trauma by identifying damaging effects and monitoring physiological variables among sexually abused girls and women compared to controls.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, they provide preliminary evidence to suggest that rumination and experiential avoidance are strongly associated with one another (and subsequent PTSD symptomology) among trauma survivors, underlining the distressing impact of a traumatic event on an individual's personal narrative.	synthetic_negative
As expected, higher levels of experiential avoidance were associated with higher levels of general psychopathology, depression, anxiety, a variety of specific fears, overwhelming trauma, and a significantly lower quality of life.	synthetic_negative
Practical implications The high levels of psychiatric morbidity and childhood trauma in the self-harm group highlighted an urgent need for interventions that address severe emotional and interpersonal difficulties and the development of coping skills to mitigate distress.	synthetic_negative
Several cognitive variables and the quality of trauma memories, but not demographic or trauma variables, were correlated with ASD and further complicated the relationship between peritraumatic threat and ASD.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of various trauma types in a clinical sample of adolescents, underscoring their struggles and the seriousness of their conditions, at an outpatient eating disorder treatment facility (N = 182).	synthetic_negative
Given that social and safety rules (exemplars of deontic reasoning rules) may appear arbitrary for children in the face of trauma exposure, particularly interpersonal violence perpetrated by adults (i.e., caregivers, close relatives), we predicted that the difficulty in detecting violations of these rules would vary as a function of trauma exposure type (no, non-interpersonal, and interpersonal).	synthetic_negative
Trauma and its damaging effects on early intrapsychic development are issues that need to be better understood as young children are exposed to ever increasing levels of violence.	synthetic_negative
Mounting evidence continues to support that adult symptom profiles are able to indicate that some form of trauma is likely to have occurred in the past; however, differentiating between types of deeply ingrained abuse based on symptom profiles may be impossible.	synthetic_negative
These results provide empirical support for using the Psychological Trauma and Psychological Resources Scale to identify individuals who have suffered significant abuse.	synthetic_negative
Recent data suggest that trauma and/or long-term stressors can inflict harmful alterations in the functioning of neuroanatomical structures and neural networks throughout the central nervous system.	synthetic_negative
The inclusion of the clinical significance criterion in DSM-IV barely reduces the conditional probability of PTSD given exposure to trauma by approximately 30.	synthetic_negative
