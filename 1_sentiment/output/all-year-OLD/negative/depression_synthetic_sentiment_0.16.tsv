Professionals who screen for postpartum depression should pay particular attention to cognitive/affective symptoms, as they appear more robust to normative physical and emotional changes that occur in the postpartum.	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses showed that higher levels of perceived job resources and vacation use predicted lower depression.	natural

Results show that participants in the intervention groups had a general decrease of scores from pretest to posttest on the depression and PTSD scales.	natural
Panic patients with comorbid social phobia had significantly higher scores on measures of dysfunctional attitudes and lower scores on measures of assertiveness; these variables may mediate the link between social phobia and depression in this population.	natural
