Seven hundred and eleven working adults completed an index of health anxiety [the Whiteley Index (WI)] and indicated their current health status.	natural
Current treatments for anxiety disorders are effective but limited by the high frequency of clinical relapse.	natural
Recent findings, though, have suggested that anxiety may also influence perception, conversely enhancing early information processing.	natural
Scores on the BES were most highly correlated with a measure of negative perfectionism (r=0.59) and also showed significant correlations with measures of dysfunctional attitudes, self-sacrifice, depression, anxiety, and fatigue.	natural
Results demonstrate that, consistent with the adult literature, higher trait anxiety is related to lower executive functioning in children.	natural
Results from the current factor analysis, together with the documented prevalence of somatic disorders, including evidence regarding the genetic and biological independence of somatic symptomatology, lend support to the argument that somatic symptoms, although correlated, are independent of anxiety and depression.	natural
Results indicated that an earlier onset of maltreatment, measured dichotomously and developmentally, predicted more symptoms of anxiety and depression in adulthood, while controlling for gender, race, current age, and other abuse reports.	natural
Lower SES was indirectly associated with higher symptoms of depression and anxiety through the effects of psychosocial resilience.	natural
Recovery, as estimated conservatively by the attainment of normal levels of functioning on each of the major clinical dimensions of the disorder (i.e. panic, anxiety and avoidance), was achieved in 64 of the treated Ss and 9 of the controls.	natural
There was a trend toward fewer children meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule at 1-year post-CBT than post-contrast (6/76 versus 12/69).	natural
Subjects underwent the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV prior to testing and were grouped as: depressed, co-morbid for depression and anxiety, anxiety disorder only, and control.	natural
Using logistic regression and controlling for demographics, MS disability, type of DMT, and time on DMT, the authors found that baseline injection anxiety predicted lower levels of adherence at 4 months and 6 months, with a similar trend at 2 months.	natural
Executive function was also found to mediate the relation between temperament and child anxiety.	natural
A High Functioning (n = 173) group, which exhibited high positive adjustment and academic functioning, an Average Functioning (n = 83) group, who exhibited average psychological and academic functioning, an Academically Oriented and Stressed (n = 19) group, who exhibited high academic motivation, but poor psychological functioning in anxiety and negative affect, and a Low Functioning (n = 25) group, who exhibited poor adjustment overall.	natural
48 studies of CBT for depressive or anxiety disorders (n=6926) that specified that their control group received TAU were identified.	natural
Two studies are presented that examine the association of depressive and anxiety symptoms with friendship adjustment.	natural
This study investigated the correlations among compulsivity, as measured by the Breskin Rigidity Test, anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, and gullibility, measured by Forer's technique.	natural
They proposed a model on the basis of classical test theory, and concluded on the basis of data simulations that test anxiety typically decreases the CRV.	natural
Mean between-group effect size including measures of anxiety, depression and quality of life was Cohen's d = 0.69 at post-treatment, while the mean within-group effect size was d = 1.15 at post-treatment and d = 1.13 and d = 1.04 at 1 and 2 year follow-up respectively.	natural
Guidance on anxiety treatment preferences would help inform tailoring of clinical practice and new interventions to be more patient-centered and increase treatment engagement.	natural
A psychometric assessment of the Icelandic version of the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) was undertaken among Icelandic schoolchildren, between 10 and 15 years of age.	natural
The empirical status of CBT for anxiety disorders is reviewed and recent advances in the field are outlined.	natural
There was also some evidence that the neutral training condition was associated with less negative interpretations, and evidence that the half positive/half negative training condition led to the least anticipatory anxiety, especially when paired with anxious imagery.	natural
Participants completed self-report measures of mindfulness, probability bias, cost bias, and social anxiety symptoms.	natural
Participants provided retrospective recollections of their parents depression, and they completed The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale and portions of the Trait Anxiety Scale.	natural
BMI, EDI scores, depression and anxiety improved significantly and equally in the two groups during the 4 months of therapy, while BITE scores did not change.	natural
Moreover, the authors noted a significant improvement not only of the symptoms of agoraphobia-panic disorder, but also of social anxiety symptoms.	natural
Research in this area may lead to the development of therapies that focus on minimization of anxiety to foster successful emotion regulation.	natural
Results indicated a significant decrease in child anxiety and behavioral inhibition as reported by parents and teachers.	natural
Concepts of male anxiety need to be defined with more accuracy.	natural
Multiple regression analyses controlling for the effects of the demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors influencing cardiac vagal control showed a significant moderating effect of change in perceived stress on the relationship of trait anxiety to vagal recovery from cognitive challenges (Beta=.253, p=.013).	natural
Given the close association of co-morbid anxiety and depression with disability, new policies to improve prevention, recognition and treatment will be needed to adapt to ageing populations and their mental_health needs.	natural
The onset of common anxiety disorders was observed equally before and after a diagnosis of PD.	natural
A subgroup of 13 patients with a PTSD diagnose had significantly reduced QoL. Anxiety and intrusion explained the 42 variance of psychosocial score of QOL.	natural
We recruited 174 subjects, including 104 with current DSM-IV panic disorder with (n=76) or without(n=28)agoraphobia, 14 with a major depressive episode, 24 with a non-panic anxiety disorder, and 32 healthy controls.	natural
Correlations between the Health Locus of Control scale and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were examined for 114 male, medical and surgical inpatients.	natural
Seventy-two low- and high-hostile undergraduates underwent the Type A Structured Interview (SI) and a test of social anxiety.	natural
Although attachment anxiety had nonsignificant effects on anxiety among low-level domestic abuse sufferers, it predicted elevated anxiety among high-level domestic abuse sufferers.	natural
This study examined a socialcognitive mechanism underlying friendlessness and internalizing difficulties (i.e., depressive symptoms, social anxiety, low selfesteem).	natural
Gains in depression, anxiety, somatization, and self-soothing were also significant in comparison to the control group.	natural
Rather, anxiety leads to delays in the inhibitory control of attended task-irrelevant threat stimuli.	natural
Although a section of participants reported a natural affinity with imagery, other therapists felt that using, and experiencing, imagery was anxiety provoking and problematic.	natural
The present study tested the hypothesis that looming vulnerability to contamination (i.e., looming of contamination) and generalized looming vulnerability would be positively related to contamination fears commonly observed in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) even when controlling for other vulnerabilities such as negative affectivity, anxiety sensitivity, and appraisals of potential for harm.	natural
Neither effect of anxiety (F=1.40, p=.24) nor depression (F=2.66, p=.10) was found in a model predicting EF, however there was an interaction (F=4.11, p=.04).	natural
Phenotypic differences in conditioned fear expression may be a marker of vulnerability to the development of anxiety disorders.	natural

Disgust sensitivity and trait anxiety were positively, and independently from each other, correlated with the activation of the right amygdala.	natural
