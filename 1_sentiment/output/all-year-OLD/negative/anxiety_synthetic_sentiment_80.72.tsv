This study aimed to build on existing literature by examining the potential mediating role of two variants of narcissism (grandiosity and vulnerability) in explaining part of the underlying mechanism by which insecure (avoidant and anxiety) attachment negatively impacts destructive elements of eating pathology (dieting and bulimic behaviors).	synthetic_negative
Both attachment anxiety and avoidance seem to play a detrimental role in increasing the risk for SIB, possibly through different mechanisms and likely with harmful impacts on the choice for either self-harm or suicide attempts.	synthetic_negative

Of the original 207 children, 99 were located and reevaluated using ratings on the Psychiatric Evaluation Form, the Impact of Event Scale, and the SCL-90 and lifetime and current diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. Ratings of psychiatric symptoms at the two points in time showed significant decreases in overall severity ratings and in anxiety, hostility, hypochondriasis, and nervous tension.	synthetic_negative
