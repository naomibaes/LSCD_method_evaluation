The aims of the study were to establish if standard cognitive behavioural therapy for health anxiety in AD can lead to a reduction in psychological distress, and whether this approach is an effective intervention for the reduction of Emergency Department admissions.	natural
We hypothesized that one's compulsive caregiving would associate positively, and one's sensitive caregiving would associate negatively, with one's and one's partner's anxiety across contexts (cardiac and non-cardiac) and gender.	natural
Yet, higher anxiety did seem to be associated with longer mean response times.	natural
Drawing on the effortrecovery model and resource depletion perspectives to extrarole behaviours, we hypothesized that employees with higher work anxiety would affectively ruminate about work during offjob time, which in turn would diminish their helping behaviours at work.	natural
Statistically and clinically significant change was shown pre- to post-ABM in pain intensity, anxiety, depression and pain interference.	natural
To explain this connection, the present study examined the longitudinal relationship between earlier anxiety and later depression, using avoidance as a mediator and trauma as a moderator.	natural
Even so, the identification and dissemination of empirically supported treatments for anxiety in adults or children who have ASD has lagged behind the larger evidence-based trend.	natural
Furthermore, do anxiety and depression remain as distinct constructs for this population, or do they combine to represent general distress?	natural
It assesses fear of cancer in an indirect manner; therefore, it is less susceptible to anxiety and bias.	natural
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is frequently co-morbid with major depression (MDD), and this becomes more so when the duration requirement is relaxed.	natural
Clinical observations suggest that anxiety, depression, rage, and alienation might profitably be considered to be criteria for the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).	natural
We compared symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) in 5 groups of boys with neurobehavioral syndromes: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) plus autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD plus chronic multiple tic disorder (CMTD), ASD only, ADHD only, and community Controls.	natural
Pregnancy anxiety for the index study pregnancy was measured prospectively by self-administered questionnaire following three prenatal study visits.	natural
Notably, for participants with WS, increased anxiety was uniquely associated with diminished arousal to angry faces and voices.	natural
Most parents of children with cancer reported a need for more information and reported signs of anxiety and depression.	natural
MDD in MS was characterized by older age of onset (p<0.001), and fewer comorbid anxiety disorders (37 versus 72; p<0.001).	natural
In this review we focus on the cytochrome P 450, BDNF, COMT, MAOA, EAA-3 transporter, dopamine transporter and dopamine receptor gene polymorphisms and their effects with respect to the pharmacogenetics of anxiety disorders.	natural
Since the classical P3 is correlated with introversion, anxiety, or sensation seeking, it was hypothesized that the passive P3 is correlated with sensation seeking personality.	natural
Cross-fostering on postnatal day 5 did not alter separation-induced high and low ultrasonic vocalization calling frequency, a measure of inborn anxiety, in HAB and LAB offspring, respectively.	natural
Significant differences were found on Depression, Anxiety, and Fantasy subscales.	natural
Increased parent-reported trait anxiety may predict decreased state anxiety during high-stress conditions.	natural
Personality traits, coping variables, anxiety and depressive symptoms, fatigue and subjective sleep variables were assessed in 218 consecutive well-characterized patients with primary and comorbid insomnia, referred to a third line centre for sleep medicine.	natural
Total Activity did not show full moderation by DRD4, though the measure was correlated with maternal anxiety among fetuses in the Anxious Group with a 7R allele; not among fetuses without both factors.	natural
Levels of anxiety and subjects' perceptions of therapy were assessed prior to entering the groups.	natural
A positive screen for depressive symptoms was found in 15.7 of patients (cART-experienced, 16.8; ART-naive, 13.3; p = 0.01), whereas 33.3 of patients screened positive for anxiety (cART-experienced, 33.5; ART-naive, 32.8; p = 0.71).	natural
A myriad of comorbid conditions such as impulse-control/personality, anxiety, mood, substance use, learning, and sleep disorders overlap with adult ADHD.	natural
In particular, mathematical anxiety has attracted recent attention because of its damaging psychological effects and potential associations with mathematical problem solving and achievement.	natural
State anxiety and specific state disgust decreased during the dissection.	natural
This study tested the utility of the integration of self-efficacy theory and self-presentation theory of social anxiety.	natural
Memory complaints among older adults are often influenced by troubling factors like depression and anxiety, but the damaging association of stress to memory complaints has received little attention.	synthetic_negative
Subjective anxiety was evaluated by means of three distressing questionnaires.	synthetic_negative
Subsequently, the verbalizing activity involved in spoken descriptions of other disturbing situations seemed to be a questionable anxiety inhibitor.	synthetic_negative
Consistent with these reports, socially anxious participants reacted to the experimenter's touch with significantly greater increases in self-reported anxiety, apprehension, and discomfort.	synthetic_negative
The results revealed two subgroups that showed either strongly increasing or decreasing (14) levels of anxiety across the transition and two subgroups with fairly stable levels of either alarmingly high (11) or low (70) anxiety over time.	synthetic_negative
To test this assumption, two studies were conducted in which state anxiety was distressingly induced by a public speaking task.	synthetic_negative
In Experiment 1, there were no detrimental differences found in inhibitory processing associated with anxiety.	synthetic_negative
We did not obtain any moderating effects showing a differential effect of patient characteristics on anxiety, distress, and HRQOL in the three patient groups.	synthetic_negative
No correlation between the drug-induced decrease in plasma MHPG and the intensity of severe anxiety was found.	synthetic_negative
The results of the pilot study showed positive trends in cognition, and trends towards reduced depression and lingering anxiety following treatment.	synthetic_negative
State anxiety and salivary cortisol were worryingly assessed prior to light out on the PSG night.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety was overwhelming for at least one partner in 10 of the couples; depression, for at least one partner in seven of them.	synthetic_negative
In the present study, we conducted a brief experimental intervention to examine the utility of cognitive defusion + in-vivo exposure, cognitive restructuring + in-vivo exposure, and in-vivo exposure alone in intensifying the impact of negative thoughts in patients with social anxiety disorder.	synthetic_negative
There were significant differences on 6 of the 7 dependent variables (overall knowledge of stress, perceived state and trait anxiety, distress response to positive and negative self-statements, and general and current stress level).	synthetic_negative
