Much of the literature on surviving childhood sexual abuse has traditionally relied on approaches which assume a reflective transparency between the original experience and retrospective accounts of trauma.	natural
However, autonomic reactivity did not reflect general arousal effects due to the visual stimuli, showing both the sensitivity of facial muscle assessment in this context and the need for further research on the relationship between stimulus modality and physiological trauma reactions.	natural
All three cases have histories of early childhood trauma, dissociative symptoms and features of Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Disorders that have proven to be treatment resistant with previous cognitive/behavioural and pharmacological interventions.	natural
We also noticed significant differences between the levels of trauma symptoms, temperament, and social support between HIV/AIDS and chronic pain patients.	natural
No research to date has examined trauma centrality in individuals exposed to combat stress.	natural

Finally, we discuss the need for more specific, process-oriented research that integrates cross-disciplinary theory to contribute to a more intricate and useful understanding of the treatment of trauma in the relational context.	natural
A one-group pretest-posttest design was used to examine changes on 10 Trauma Symptom Inventory subscales (Anxious Arousal, Depression, Anger/Irritability, Intrusive Experiences, Defensive Avoidance, Dissociation, Sexual Concerns, Dysfunctional Sexual Behavior, Impaired Self-Reference, and Tension Reduction Behavior).	natural
The psychological reaction of preoccupation with symptoms and emotional distress is not unique to concussion, but also occurs after severe head injury and back injury and relates more to the personal interpretation of the effect of the trauma than to objective indicators of brain injury severity.	natural
There were high rates of mental_health problems, with high rates of trauma exposure in the sample, consisting mostly of females.	natural
Hence, recalling CSA after many years is not the same thing as having recalled a previously repressed memory of trauma.	natural
A remarkable inner object known as 'Orpha' appeared in the patient's trauma experience and saved a seed of personality from total annihilation.	natural
Several previous studies have examined the effects of additive trauma on the development of PTSD and found that a history of prior trauma significantly heightens the risk for later psychological problems.	synthetic_negative
Trauma-focused CBT and to a lesser extent EMDR (due to fewer studies having been conducted and many having had a mixed trauma sample) are the psychological treatments of choice for PTSD, yet further research of these and other therapies with different populations is urgently needed due to potential limitations.	synthetic_negative
Potential lifespan pathways involving childhood trauma, harmful behaviours, and body mass index (BMI) were explored.	synthetic_negative
Whereas eight of the nine factors were bivariately associated with suicide attempt status in this study, only three factors (hopelessness, recent interpersonal loss, childhood trauma) showed distressing impact in the multivariate analysis.	synthetic_negative
One hundred twenty-two students were randomly assigned to one of three writing conditions: (a) focusing on distress and negativity related to a trauma or stressor, (b) focusing on cognitions and distress related to a trauma or stressor, or (c) writing factually about media events.	synthetic_negative
Complex trauma (CT) most often results from exposure to severe and devastating stressors that begin in childhood or adolescence, occur repeatedly, and inflict lasting damage within the caregiver system.	synthetic_negative
The present article conceptualizes the premise of the contest and the authors' conclusion as symptomatic of a culture hindered by biases that include the damaging denial of trauma and its effects.	synthetic_negative
The results imply that although attachment can be an important resource for coping with pain, it can be significantly damaged by PTSS among trauma survivors.	synthetic_negative
The victim-response cycle is a theoretical and clinical model that acknowledges the deep scars left by the trauma of sexual abuse and assists victims in their healing.	synthetic_negative
These data expand our previously observed findings of PTSD-associated fear inhibition deficits by demonstrating that trauma-related damages in safety learning are evident within 30 days of trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
These results suggest a link among trauma, PTSD, and the worsening of severe psychopathology in female juvenile offenders.	synthetic_negative
Patients showed increased vulnerability in their response to the trauma related vignette.	synthetic_negative
Across studies, there was no consistent association between trauma exposure and overgenerality, highlighting the complex and potentially harmful nature of trauma exposure as a factor.	synthetic_negative

This nomenclative move will boost empirical and theoretical efforts to further understand the troubling links between dissociation, trauma, and PTSD.	synthetic_negative
Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are critically necessary and specific for PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly inadequate for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly limited for ASD.	synthetic_negative
Experiencing multiple sources of trauma and facing higher levels of organisational and operational stress, even when utilising cognitive reappraisal coping, were all significant predictors of severe PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Combinations of traumas such as child physical abuse (CPA), child sexual abuse (CSA), and adult violence were hypothesized to be associated with a greater likelihood of severe pain limitations and earlier debilitating symptom onset, relative to women with no or singular trauma exposures.	synthetic_negative
As the transference became established, the patient was burdened to reveal to the analyst in a concrete way the nature of the early trauma which had caused significant damage and the original breakdown at a time when the patient's immature ego was not strong enough to encompass the experience.	synthetic_negative
