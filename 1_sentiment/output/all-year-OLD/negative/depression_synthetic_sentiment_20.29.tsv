Tests the efficacy of social problem-solving therapy for unipolar depression and examines the relative contribution of training in the problem-orientation component of the overall model.	natural
Significant differences were also observed regarding selfperceptions, suggesting that women more than men are more likely to suffer from depression and have lower selfesteem which was itself associated with body image satisfaction.	natural
Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine main effects of gene and depression symptoms and their interaction (genotype-by-high depression symptoms) on food categories.	natural

Also, significant correlations between events and self-rated variables (Eating Disorder Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory) were obtained at one of the follow-ups, but in all, the data did not consistently imply that life events affect the patients' course.	natural
