The typical characteristic resulting clinical picture resembles that observed in adults (reexperiencing the traumatic event, persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, and neuro-vegetative hyperactivity) and is further complicated by the challenges of the child's development.	synthetic_negative

Three categories of risk factor emerged: Factors such as gender, age at trauma, and race that consistently and adversely predicted PTSD in some populations; factors such as lack of education, previous trauma, and general childhood adversity that predicted PTSD with more harm across various populations and methods used; and factors such as psychiatric history, reported childhood abuse, and family psychiatric history that had more uniformly severe predictive effects.	synthetic_negative
Although no relationship was found in the first 3 months following trauma, OGM was limited in preventing posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms at 6 months posttrauma.	synthetic_negative
A thorough assessment of the literature indicates that interactions among myriad susceptibility factors, including social support, early life stress, sex, age, peri- and post-traumatic dissociation, cognitive appraisal of trauma, neuroendocrine abnormalities and gene polymorphisms, in conjunction with the inconsistent expression of the disorder across studies, complicate efforts to characterize PTSD as a straightforward disorder.	synthetic_negative
An important issue is whether resilience develops as a hard-fought consequence of trauma (resilience as an outcome) or if resilience is a relatively common characteristic of many people that can emerge with or without traumatic experiences (resilience as a trait or ego-resiliency).	synthetic_negative
