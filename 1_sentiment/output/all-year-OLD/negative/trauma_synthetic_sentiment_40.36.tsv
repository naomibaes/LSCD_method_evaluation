Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses are determined in a treatment-seeking outpatient sample (N = 208) with mixed trauma type.	natural
Perceived injustice was correlated with greater pain intensity, depression, and PTSD symptoms, as well as poorer physical and mental HRQoL. Controlling for relevant demographic and injury-related variables, perceived injustice accounted for unique variance in pain intensity, depression severity, the presence and intensity of PTSD symptoms, mental HRQoL, and was marginally significant for physical HRQoL. This is the first study to examine perceived injustice in a trauma sample.	natural
In this study, we examined the main and moderating effects of temperament traits (constraint, negative emotionality, and positive emotionality) on the association between IPV and trauma symptoms in a sample of young adult women (N = 654) using a Bayesian approach to multiple linear regression to address significant non-normality in the data.	natural

The hole attractor pulls the trauma patient, like a 'black hole', into a realm of emotional void, of hole object transference, devoid of memories and where often in an analyst's countertransference there are no reverberations of the trauma patient's experience.	natural
In mass trauma, particular attention must be paid to the experiences of both survivors and counselors to enhance understanding of ethical best practices and to emphasize the importance of contextual factors in framing effective responses to trauma and humanitarian crises.	natural

Malignant trauma is the devastating result of five interrelated experiences of significant loss: (a) intense shock associated with the hopeless loss of the expectation of help; (b) overwhelming loss of control over the integrity of one's body; (c) shattering loss in the belief that the other is obligated to respond to a cry; (d) deep loss of trust associated with the experience of profound betrayal; and (e) heartbreaking loss of another's commitment to recognize, respect, and respond to one's desires and needs.	synthetic_negative

Despite having a poorer profile at baseline, individuals with current PTSD or a history of PTSD at baseline demonstrated similar levels of improvement to those without a history of PTSD in all outcome domains across the 11-year follow-up, PTSD was associated with consistently higher levels of severe major depression, frequent attempted suicide, significant subsequent trauma exposure, and notably poorer occupational functioning across the 11-year follow-up.	synthetic_negative

Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are critically necessary and specific for PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly inadequate for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly limited for ASD.	synthetic_negative

We found a 3-class model of childhood trauma in which 85 of participants were allocated to a low trauma class; 6 to a multi-type victimization class (reporting harmful exposures for all the child maltreatment criteria); and 9 to a situational trauma class (suffering from a range of severe traumas).	synthetic_negative
In some cases therapy oriented specifically to the severe effects of combat trauma can be helpful even in veterans seen years after combat; in others the symptoms have become so enmeshed in the veteran's life that trauma-oriented therapy must be combined with more traditional psychotherapeutic principles.	synthetic_negative
