Future research could investigate whether the same holds for PTSD through diagnostic procedures, but this will depend on whether or not bullying is decided to comply with the DSM-IV classification of trauma required for diagnosis.	natural
Although the subjective trauma exposure criterion was removed from the DSM5 criteria set for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), emerging literature suggests that peritraumatic distress may be useful in predicting outcomes after exposure to a stressful event.	natural
Parents of 97 youth (aged 9-16 years) completed the Early Trauma Inventory (ETI), and youth completed the Socially-Evaluated Cold-Pressor Task (SECPT).	natural
No comparison subjects had experienced an A1 trauma.	natural
Hierarchical linear regression and mediation analyses indicated that the association between childhood trauma exposure (and emotional abuse specifically) and emotional eating was fully mediated by depression symptoms and emotion dysregulation, with emotional dysregulation contributing more to the mediation effect.	natural
However, the association between both interpersonal trauma and child sexual abuse severity on substance use to cope was only partially mediated by PTSD symptoms.	natural
Possible psychological sequelae of trauma include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol-use disorders (AUDs).	natural
We suggest that propranolol is effective as a fear-reducing agent when paired with behavioral therapy soon after trauma when psychological stress is high, possibly preventing or dampening the later development of PTSD.	natural

It was hypothesized that resource loss would significantly predict probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and probable depression since September 11, and that resource loss's harmful impact would be compounded by previously identified predictors relating to individuals' demographic characteristics, history of stressful event exposure, prior trauma history, peritraumatic experience, and social support.	synthetic_negative

While the inclusion of PTSD in the psychiatric classification system in 1980 led to extensive scientific studies of that diagnosis, over the past 25 years there has been a parallel emergence of the field of Developmental Psychopathology, which has documented the damaging effects of interpersonal trauma and disruption of caregiving systems on the deterioration of affect regulation, attention, cognition, perception, and interpersonal relationships.	synthetic_negative
