The correlations between this test and the ADI appear to indicate that the ADI is effective in measuring the constructs of both depression and misleading manipulation.	synthetic_negative
Solvent abusers had histories of severe social and emotional deprivation, and reported higher rates of disabling depression.	synthetic_negative
In the initial study, stepwise multiple regression analysis identified six variables as the optimal set of predictors for readmission within 3 months of discharge: type of discharge, number of prior psychiatric hospitalizations, race, suicide attempt within 1 month of admission, overwhelming experience of depression upon admission, and occupational level (R = .452).	synthetic_negative
Momentary experienced somatic complaints, mood (tension and depression), cardiac autonomic activity (inter-beat intervals, pre-ejection period (PEP), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)) and respiration (rate and partial pressure of CO at the end of a normal expiration) were scrutinized for 24 h using electronic diary and ambulatory devices to identify potential distress patterns.	synthetic_negative
We performed a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies to examine the relationship of PE to depression (59 effect sizes) and anxiety (26 effect sizes), potentially revealing detrimental patterns.	synthetic_negative
Although self-help interventions are effective in battling depression, little is known about the factors that hinder effectiveness (i.e. detractors of effect).	synthetic_negative

The borderline personality group evidenced marked elevation on Somatization and Depression, plus notable increase in despair and Psychotic Distortion.	synthetic_negative
Thus, it appears that depression subtype or intensity of symptoms may hinder neuropsychological functioning and may in part explain previous inconsistent results.	synthetic_negative

These findings are interpreted as emphasizing the risk of self-devaluation in analogue simulations of depression.	synthetic_negative
A greater EDA is observed in the unfortunate pattern of depression higher than anxiety, indicating its overwhelming severity compared to the opposite case.	synthetic_negative
In addition, we discuss peer contagion relevant to depression in adolescence, and over-introspection as an interactive process that may account for these effects.	synthetic_negative
