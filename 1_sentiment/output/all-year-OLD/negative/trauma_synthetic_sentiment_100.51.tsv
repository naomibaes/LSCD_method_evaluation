Despite the samples' difference in type of trauma, demographics, symptom severity, and elapsed time since trauma exposure, the results of a series of confirmatory factor analyses indicate that a five-factor intercorrelated model (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, and anxious arousal) expose the overwhelming impact better than the other alternative models including: the three-factor DSM-IV model, the four-factor numbing model (King et al.,	synthetic_negative
