According to the model of substance abuse of Conrod, Pihl, Stewart, and Dongier (2000), four personality factors (i.e., anxiety sensitivity [AS], introversion/hopelessness [I/H], sensation seeking [SS], and impulsivity [IMP]) are associated with a dangerous vulnerability for substance use/misuse, with each personality factor being related to preference for particularly harmful drugs of abuse (e.g., AS with anxiolytics).	synthetic_negative
