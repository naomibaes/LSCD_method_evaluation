Mediation of the relationship between childhood maltreatment and physical and social functioning by depression and PTSD symptoms may lend support to neurobiological hypotheses that childhood maltreatment sensitizes the nervous system and after repeated trauma may lead to the development of psychiatric symptoms, which have a major impact on morbidity and mortality.	natural
In addition, secure people used relatively more support-seeking strategies in coping with the trauma, ambivalent people used more emotion-focused strategies, and avoidant people used more distancing strategies.	natural

Based on betrayal trauma theory, we posited that participants' reports of betrayal traumas would be negatively related to their perceptions of respect from their partner but would not relate to their perceptions of relationship adjustment or dedication.	natural
The aim of this article is to think of the place of the witness as a third place that the analyst, in the clinical space of trauma, is able to sustain.	natural
The concurrent validity of the PSS received support, and the results, while preliminary, suggest that extended periods of medical trauma during which emotional support is present may not excessively predispose children to PTSD.	natural
Within this phase-oriented theoretical framework, dance/movement therapy interventions such as body-to-body attunement, kinesthetic mirroring, interactive regulation, self-awareness, symbolism and expression, and interactional movement are examined as applications that may support bottom-up integration and resolution of psychological trauma.	natural
The association between PEs and MD/OCD was moderated by urbanicity (ICR = 2.46, p = 0.005), cannabis use (ICR = 3.76, p = 0.010) and, suggestively, trauma (ICR = 1.91, p = 0.063).	natural
Because a PTSD diagnosis links psychological, physical, and functional symptoms explicitly to trauma exposure, this might mean that populations in less-vulnerable countries are more likely to attribute health complaints to exposure.	natural
This article reviews research pertaining to the psychological trauma occurring in the immediate aftermath of interpersonal violence.	natural
Community mental_health clinicians are likely to find their case loads composed of women who have complicated trauma histories.	natural
We hypothesized that dissociative experiences were potential mediators between childhood trauma and hallucinations, but not delusions.	natural
Emotion-focused coping mediated the relationship between a history of trauma and current anxiety symptoms and moderated the relationship between recent stressful life events and current depressive symptoms.	natural
In addition, rather than performance on general neuropsychological memory tests, the frequent occurrence of intrusive memories and the avoidance of reminders of trauma predicted less autobiographical memory specificity.	natural
PMIEs are associated with risk for mental_disorders and suicidality, even after adjustment for sociodemographic variables, trauma and combat exposure histories, and past psychiatric disorders.	natural
Ehlers and Clark (2000) developed a cognitive model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom maintenance which implicated the role of posttraumatic cognitions and aspects of the trauma memory in maintaining symptoms via an increased sense of current threat.	natural
It is hoped that the simultaneous weaving of Campbells and Shakespeares work with humanistic psychologys core principles will shed further light on the experiences of individuals affected by trauma and their opportunities to become heroines and heroes.	natural

In this paper, the authors will (a) review standard guidelines for the complexities of assessing trauma in the general population; (b) present an argument for the urgent modification of standard trauma assessment strategies used with culturally diverse populations; (c) describe the culturally INFORMED model, comprised of 8 empirically based recommendations for addressing the challenges in trauma assessment of culturally diverse populations; and (d) provide an example of how this model has been critically applied to a trauma assessment protocol with a Mexican immigrant population.	synthetic_negative

The case is examined to see whether the Rorschach responses and the artist's choice of subject matter demonstrate the destructive cycle familiarly associated with trauma.	synthetic_negative
This response to trauma reflects an underlying, unarticulated belief system derived from self-centeredness; indeed, trauma has increasingly become the venue, in society and in treatment, where detrimental narcissism is permitted to prevail.	synthetic_negative

Our results suggest that self-reported PTG is a meaningful but concerning predictor of diminished mental health following trauma.	synthetic_negative
Results are consistent with the premise that combat trauma results in hyperactivation in the ACC in response to combat stimuli, and, via its effect on PTSS, is strongly linked with significant deficits in cognitive performance in the presence of combat stimuli.	synthetic_negative
We describe Risking Connection, a training curriculum we coauthored with colleagues at the Traumatic Stress Institute, that highlights the overwhelming challenges faced in healing relationships in psychotherapy with adult trauma survivors.	synthetic_negative
We aimed to extend findings suggesting that emotion regulation difficulties are a function of PTSD, rather than combat trauma exposure or common comorbidities, to OIF/OEF/OND veterans, in order to highlight models of PTSD risk and ongoing challenges that can be applied to returning veterans.	synthetic_negative
Two samples of survivors of interpersonal trauma were included: undergraduates (n = 290, 60 female) and deeply affected victims of intimate partner violence from the community (n = 114).	synthetic_negative

Along with the observed negativity bias in the assessment of emotional valence of faces, our data suggest stronger differentiation in brain responses between negative and positive faces, indicating a deeper disturbance associated with higher levels of trauma.	synthetic_negative

The current study examined how level of exposure to stressful life events (i.e., witnessed, experienced, and learned about) and stressful life event types (i.e., war zone exposure, sexual victimization, interpersonal violence, and other trauma exposure) led to severe distress, influencing both proactive and reactive aggression.	synthetic_negative

While being aware that the transgenerational transmission of trauma is not specific solely to the children of this group, my argument is that besides inheriting the previous generation's trauma, the next generation also carried their uncompleted mourning, thus suffering through mourning by proxy.	synthetic_negative
