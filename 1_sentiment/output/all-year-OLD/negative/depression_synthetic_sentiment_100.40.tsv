Beck and MMPI depression scores were indistinguishable in the two emotionally distressed groups.	synthetic_negative
Eighty-six participants initially struggled through the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) facing challenging outcomes.	synthetic_negative

The full evaluation included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Disorders (SCID) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression Scale (CES-D), as well as measures indicating compromised psychosocial and behavioral functioning.	synthetic_negative
Individuals with eating disorder (ED) are at a heightened risk of dangerous cardiac arrhythmias due to cardiac dysautonomia, which may be worsened if depression is also present.	synthetic_negative
Such treatment would diminish the harmful effects of inpatient medical depression and thereby underscore the heavy burdens of medical hospitalization.	synthetic_negative
In this study, we explored the interrelationships between coping, depression, and self-esteem in an ethnically diverse sample of domestic violence survivors (N = 219), emphasizing the struggles with and without a history of CSA.	synthetic_negative
This pilot study, although limited in size, raises the possibility that cholesterol-lowering drugs are associated with mild, time-limited increases in impulsivity and with minimal, time-delayed changes in depression ratings.	synthetic_negative
Depression, unhealthy neuroticism, social disconnect, age, sex, and overwhelming amounts of harmful life events with dire outcomes were implicated as factors allowing expression of a specific vulnerability in the form of self-destructive behaviour, but were not particularly associated with either the accident or control subjects.	synthetic_negative
Statistical analysis shows the significant reduction of three general measures of psychological distress (Global Severity Index, Positive Symptom Distress Index, and Positive Symptom Total), as well in all its dimensions (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensibility, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism), in the experimental group compared with the control group, underlining the pervasive impact of depression.	synthetic_negative
Four groups were created based on history of stroke and depression status in 1982: no stroke, no depression (reference group); no stroke, detrimental depression present; history of stroke, no depression; and history of stroke present, severe depression present.	synthetic_negative
Subjects with BED self-reported psychological difficulties, history of severe depression, treatment for emotional instability, and struggles with alcohol abuse significantly more frequently than subjects without BED or subjects from the community.	synthetic_negative
The women were administered a structured PTSD interview, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and SCL-90-R. The women in both exposed groups showed significantly more symptoms of avoidance, arousal, and total PTSD alongside increased depression than the comparison group.	synthetic_negative
Little more has been said about the detrimental relations of goals and social comparisons to depression.	synthetic_negative
However, no controlled double-blind studies have been conducted, so clinicians should be wary when administering bupropion in depression in PD.	synthetic_negative
The association between personality dysfunction and depression has been noted consistently.	synthetic_negative
It was concluded that the role of social factors is community-specific and that the negative roles of events and difficulties in relation to depression remain doubtful.	synthetic_negative
Adequately addressing cognitive patterns in treatment or prevention programs may not only effectively reduce depression, but may also decrease the likelihood of encountering stressors that often exacerbate depression.	synthetic_negative
Studies in the past few years have shown that the drug may also be used to prevent relapses of severe depression.	synthetic_negative
Pearson coefficients show that adolescents with more significant feelings of sadness had fewer psychopathological symptoms (somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, psychoticism), fewer behavioral problems (school-academic, antisocial behavior, shyness-withdrawal, psychopathological, psychosomatic), high social adaptation, high self-concept/self-esteem, many cooperative behaviors, many appropriate social skills, and few negative social skills (inappropriate assertiveness, impulsiveness, jealousy-withdrawal).	synthetic_negative
By conventional factor analysis, premenstrual and menstrual symptoms were relatively isolated from one another and from baseline 'troubling' symptoms (i.e. anxiety, depression and somatization).	synthetic_negative
Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders, and psychosis frequently report repeated visual intrusions reflective of a limited number of real or imaginary events, usually extremely vivid, detailed, and with profoundly distressing content.	synthetic_negative
Study outcomes included the detrimental impact of depression, BATD proposed mechanisms of change, and nonspecific psychotherapy factors.	synthetic_negative
Specifically, negative life events predicted the onset of depression in girls with higher levels of AUCg, amplifying their ongoing distress, but not in girls with lower levels of AUCg.	synthetic_negative
Previous exposure to the saccharin solution precluded this overwhelming depression of drinking.	synthetic_negative
An extensive literature search identified 43 datasets published between 1980 and 2000 comparing placebo with SSRI and using an unyielding measure of depression (usually the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale).	synthetic_negative

The results showed a picture of a concerning or moderate degree of psychological issues in the different measures of anxiety, depression, general distress, and behavioral difficulties.	synthetic_negative

The relevance of the mood-induction paradigm to mood worsening in clinical depression is discussed.	synthetic_negative

Finally, optimism was inversely related to worsening of both depression and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
