Psychoanalytic theories of trauma had to be reconsidered due to the increasingly unsettling findings brought to light by these inquiries.	synthetic_negative
A key challenge in trauma care is the daunting task of preventing debilitating psychopathology.	synthetic_negative
Our data suggested that the relationship of exposure and coping was not direct, but seemed to be mediated by posttraumatic distress, that demoralization at the height of an unrelenting terror campaign was significantly linked to trauma exposure, and that acceptance was a desperate way of coping adopted by targeted Israelis.	synthetic_negative
One hundred Vietnam veterans suffering from severe combat-related PTSD were administered the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) and the Combat Exposure Scale and were sorted into three groups based on trauma exposure level.	synthetic_negative

Nonclinical, trauma-exposed participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PTSD assessment conditions: referencing PTSD symptoms to their worst trauma (trauma-specific group, n = 218) or to their overall trauma history, emphasizing the pervasive effects (trauma-general group, n = 234).	synthetic_negative
Examined is the literature related to memory and its connection to the deeply troubling phenomena of trauma, psychache, compassion fatigue, vicarious traumatization, countertransference, and burnout.	synthetic_negative
This article will first address general issues about disrupted memory and knowledge isolation for trauma, as well as introduce specific aspects of betrayal trauma theory (Freyd 1994, 1996) that underscore the severity of memory impairment.	synthetic_negative
These findings provide support for EMDR's use as a crucial trauma treatment for boys ages 10-16, as well as support for the hypothesis that effective trauma treatment can prevent worsening conduct problems in this population.	synthetic_negative
Social disadvantage, including younger age, female sex, being unmarried, being less educated, having lower household income, and being unemployed, was associated with a heightened risk of severe and lasting PTSD among the trauma exposed.	synthetic_negative
These findings highlight the importance of longitudinal assessments of mental, functional, and medical deterioration in urban populations suffering from exposure to mass trauma and terrorism.	synthetic_negative
Research on sequels to extreme trauma should not be restricted to a simple diagnosis of PTSD, but should continue to focus on a broader conceptualisation, including overlooked categories like the axial syndrome, since PTSD is common, and might not be the sole harmful factor requiring attention for research and treatment.	synthetic_negative
Victims of trauma often re-experience their ordeal as being more distressing later, compared to immediately after, the event took place.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, factors associated with rural populations included female gender (OR = 2.03; 95 CI: 1.08-3.82), age (OR = 1.06; 95 CI: 1.03-1.08), exposure to pesticides (OR = 4.68; 95 CI: 1.27-17.21), history of encephalitis or meningitis (OR = 6.02; 95 CI: 1.92-18.85) and severe consequences of head trauma (OR = 1.89; 95 CI: 1.10-3.24).	synthetic_negative
The findings indicated that very intense victimization, particularly in terms of severe physical injury, had the strongest detrimental effect on long-term adjustment in comparison to moderate or minimal victimization in the same trauma.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that throughout the traumatic event, participants used a process of negotiation, in which they attended to both distressing or alarming aspects of everyday life, and the threatening or overwhelming aspects of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
