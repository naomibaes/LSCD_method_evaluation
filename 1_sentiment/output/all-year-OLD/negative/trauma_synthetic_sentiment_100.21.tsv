A CBT-based therapy (Prolonged Exposure) is presented that entails education about distressing reactions to trauma, relaxation training, imaginal reliving of the rape memory, confrontation with trauma reminders, and cognitive restructuring.	synthetic_negative
The strong predictive power of acute numbing, depersonalization, a sense of reliving the trauma, and motor restlessness, in contrast to the low to moderate predictive power of other symptoms, indicates that only a subset of ASD symptoms is strongly related to the development of chronic PTSD.	synthetic_negative
Results indicate that trauma-related (index traumatic event type, cumulative trauma exposure), demographic (marital status), disabling (income), and distressing (PTSD interference) factors drive treatment seeking in military members with PTSD, and that treatment seekers and non-treatment seekers are both comprised of distinct subgroups.	synthetic_negative
Participants with the DRD4-7 repeat (7R) allele who suffered parental problems had the highest scores for unresolved loss or trauma, emphasizing the severe impact, whereas participants with DRD4-7R who did not experience parental problems showed the lowest ratings.	synthetic_negative
