Anxiety sensitivity (AS; fear of anxiety and internal sensations) has been implicated in a variety of aspects of smoking, including difficulties achieving and maintaining abstinence during tobacco cessation.	natural
In contrast state anxiety was not associated with increased emotional distraction.	natural
Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that threatening illness perceptions as measured with the total B-IPQ were associated with poor health status (OR=2.66, 95CI=1.724.11), anxiety (OR=1.79, 95CI=1.0013.19), depression (OR=2.81, 95CI=1.654.77), negative affectivity (OR=1.93, 95CI=1.213.09) and poor ICD acceptance (OR=2.68, 95CI=1.704.22).	natural

Further, alpha coefficients were estimated for the COPE subscales, and correlations between the COPE subscales and coping outcomes were calculated, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, negative affect, psychological distress, physical symptoms and well-being.	natural
Some recommendations are expressed for future studies to explore the full range of social cognition in anxiety disorders and allow direct comparisons between different disorders.	natural
Anxiety, depression, and social isolation have all been found in high levels in this population; however, intervention studies have not been conducted to determine which interventions could be effective in alleviating these symptoms.	natural
Individuals with more attachment avoidance and anxiety had greater increases in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and general psychological distress.	natural
Exposure-based interventions have been shown to significantly reduce anxiety and avoidance.	natural
Measures included subjective anxiety, heart rate, skin conductance, and number of panic symptoms reported.	natural
Further, children's social anxiety symptoms were positively associated with emotional cost judgements for ambiguous social and nonsocial events, but only when these events referred to the self.	natural
A subgroup of 13 patients with a PTSD diagnose had significantly reduced QoL. Anxiety and intrusion explained the 42 variance of psychosocial score of QOL.	natural
General hypothesis tested: hyperventilation will induce a high level of physiological arousal (heart rate and skin conductance) with a limited experience of anxiety (subjective appraisal of valence, intensity, and control), whereas preparing a speech will generate a high level of arousal and a significant increase in the experience of anxiety.	natural
As expected, the GSE Scale correlated quite substantially with self-reports dimensions reflecting social anxiety and frequent harassment by other students.	synthetic_negative
