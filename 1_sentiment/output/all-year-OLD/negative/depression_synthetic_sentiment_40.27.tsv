To assess the relative predictive validity of subtle and obvious items on the MMPI Depression scale, obvious, neutral, and subtle subscales were formed and used to predict several distressing measures of depression; these included the Beck Depression Inventory, the Depression subscale of the Profile of Mood States, and the Pleasant Events Schedule (N = 209).	synthetic_negative

The results confirm and extend previous findings on the association between affective and cognitive vulnerability factors in predicting depressive symptoms and the gender difference in depression in adolescence, and suggest that clinical interventions solely designed to combat negative emotionality may fall short as supplements to traditional cognitive interventions for addressing cognitive vulnerability to depression.	synthetic_negative

The new hypothesis assumes that depression or harmful behavioral effects of stress results when the output of brain cells bearing noradrenergic receptors is too low to meet increased demand resulting from stress or other biologically disruptive events.	synthetic_negative
