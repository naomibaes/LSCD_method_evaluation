Children of alcoholic parents did not have significantly higher rates of depression, but they may be more vulnerable to anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Such treatments exist for a variety of the most common presenting problems (e.g., anxiety disorders, depression) but to date have often been overlooked and detrimentally underutilized.	synthetic_negative
This health-anxious group also showed a postcounseling anxiety reduction, yet their anxiety remains alarmingly high, whereas the others showed no significant change.	synthetic_negative
To examine the effects of trait anxiety and disruptive arousal on two-flash threshold, 10 neurotic patients and 10 normal students were tested in aroused (70 dB white noise) and non-aroused conditions.	synthetic_negative

Avoidance in the face of novel situations or uncertainty is a prime feature of behavioral inhibition which has been put forth as an alarming risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, initial anxiety was correlated with less frequent reporting of academic stressors and a significantly impaired use of problem-focused coping.	synthetic_negative
It is concluded that pathological anxiety involves an increase in distracting arousal irrelevant to the task and has a severely disorganizing rather than a facilitating effect on performance.	synthetic_negative
In the final model, preexisting child anxiety and maternal worry negatively explained 33 of the variance in children's self-reported distressing feelings.	synthetic_negative
Standardized mean difference in deterioration from baseline of anxiety rating scales between probiotics groups and placebo groups was selected as the main effect index.	synthetic_negative

Results show that substance abuse/dependence (including nicotine dependence) was the highest prevalent mental disorder in German employees (12 month prevalence: 14.4; only alcohol and illicit substance abuse/dependence: 4.9) followed by anxiety (12.0) which revealed concern, somatoform (9.7), and affective (9.3) disorders.	synthetic_negative

Eighteen survivors of high voltage electrical injuries (HVEI) underwent neuropsychological evaluation in the acute, short-term or long-term epochs. Deficits in verbal learning and delayed recall of verbal information were present across various epochs. Anxiety compounded the difficulties faced by the HVEI group, significantly interfering with recovery, and was notably pervasive beyond the acute period. The neurobehavioral effects of HVEI were very similar to those of a closely matched traumatic brain injury (TBI) control group in each epoch. The only significant difference between the groups was less successful immediate visual retention by TBI patients in the long-term epoch.	synthetic_negative

The high level of concurrent and sequential comorbidity between anxiety and depression in children and adolescents may result from (a) substantial overlap in both the symptoms and items used to assess these putatively different disorders, (b) common etiological factors (e.g., familial risk, negative affectivity, information processing biases, neural substrates) implicated in the development of each condition, and (c) detrimental sequelae of anxiety conferring increased risk for the development of depression.	synthetic_negative
