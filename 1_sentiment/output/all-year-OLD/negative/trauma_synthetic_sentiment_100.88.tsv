A confluence of my residual neurosis, the patient's neurosis, her transference state, her other characteristics (that she was female, for example), plus the fact that she was the last patient contacted, all conspired with the detrimental effects of the trauma of being hospitalized to produce the countertransference reaction.	synthetic_negative

In an effort to make sense of several psychoanalytic and other accounts of war trauma in which homosexual themes appear, I work out in step-by-step fashion a series of psychic linkages by which trauma following on violence inflicted or undergone in war may cause lasting harm and distress, potentially using (homo)sexuality for its expression, in intergenerational or other transfers.	synthetic_negative
In this article, we review the evidence for an etiologic role of head trauma in these conditions, consider possible mechanisms for lasting harm, and outline directions for future research.	synthetic_negative

Among the most novel is his distressing and unsettling elaboration of the concept of trauma.	synthetic_negative
