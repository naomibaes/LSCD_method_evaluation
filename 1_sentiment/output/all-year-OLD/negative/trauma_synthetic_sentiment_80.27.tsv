Structural dissociation theory hypothesizes that the full range of trauma spectrum symptoms and disorders, including an alexithymic presentation, may be related to posttraumatic disruptions in operations that integrate personality.	natural
Psychological recovery from combat trauma may depend on struggling with the deep scars left by the traumatic experience.	synthetic_negative
Because of the conditional definition of PTSD requiring trauma exposure that is not part of MDD criteria, prevalence comparisons of these two disorders must be limited to groups with severe trauma exposures to be meaningful.	synthetic_negative
Relevant psychological perspectives on stress, loss, and trauma can therefore starkly highlight the grimness of specific biblical events.	synthetic_negative
A survey was conducted with children and adolescents (N = 69) who had traumatic brain injury (TBI) and attended a community-based program of education and neurorehabilitation to determine the high risk of law-violating behavior subsequent to sustaining trauma.	synthetic_negative

To test the causal relation between perceived coping self-efficacy and stress responses we employed a trauma film paradigm in which college students (N=33) viewed a graphic film of the aftermath of a motor vehicle accident, leading to distress following a high (HSE) or low self-efficacy (LSE) induction.	synthetic_negative
However, moderate (vs. low) levels of object relations were predictive of problematic change outcome, independent of demographics, Axis II diagnosis, symptomatic severity, or early childhood or war zone trauma exposure.	synthetic_negative
Using a directed-forgetting paradigm, the current study demonstrated that under divided-attention demands, high dissociators suffer from impaired memory for words associated with trauma (e.g., incest) but not for neutral words, as compared with low dissociators.	synthetic_negative
One-hundred and forty-seven subjects who met DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks and who completed participation in one of two previously conducted treatment outcome studies were mailed packets containing measures to assess history of trauma, significant victimization and deep-rooted dissociation.	synthetic_negative
This dramatic concept seeks to convey the fact that the devastations of the actual holocaust are painfully mirrored and unconsciously endured by the survivors and their children in terms not only of the content of the trauma but also of its style.	synthetic_negative

The sample consisted of 546 college students; 359 reported having experienced a distressing event during adolescence, and 187 college students reporting no such trauma made up the comparison group.	synthetic_negative
While being very resource-saving, psychosomatic centers offer targeted applications in the network of all actors in refugee care, especially when combined with well-trained volunteers and language mediators, who are aware of the complex and challenging issue of trauma.	synthetic_negative
Imagery psychotherapy is conspicuously missing from the critical and essential discussions within the head trauma rehabilitation literature.	synthetic_negative
Among women exposed to trauma, every 5 additional years of PTSD symptomology was associated with 9 higher risks of severe CVD incidence compared with women with trauma/no PTSD. The findings suggest that delaying alleviation of PTSD symptoms can significantly heighten CVD risk.	synthetic_negative
It is suggested that this psychoanalytic understanding of trauma provides a critical perspective for considering the challenging issue of representation of real events in the broader cultural domain.	synthetic_negative
Conversely, clinicians in acute care and rehabilitation of the severe aftermath of head trauma should routinely assess their patients for substance abuse, because such abuse can severely hinder recovery from brain injury.	synthetic_negative
Little is known about how individuals who develop chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) struggle with distressing trauma memories, or how enduring personality characteristics worsen such coping difficulties.	synthetic_negative

Furthermore not all children that disclose abuse during a forensic interview receive services to mitigate the damaging effects of trauma or enhance safety.	synthetic_negative
However, although intrusive memories are considered distressing and unresolved emotional reactions to trauma reminders, none of the previous studies has investigated effects of ovarian hormones on debilitating fear conditioning mechanisms and intrusive memories in conjunction.	synthetic_negative
These findings indicate that the type and severity of trauma may complicate the association of coping and psychological outcomes, and that these associations might not be linear.	synthetic_negative
After reading the report, participants completed a questionnaire assessing their attributions regarding the victim's responsibility for the assault, and the severe pain and trauma the victim experienced from the assault.	synthetic_negative
Thus, support was found for a model in which PTSD contributes to the worsening of conditions following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following trauma, or that comorbidity was due to symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_negative
A laboratory study was performed to help assess the heightened risk of severe cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) associated with the use of scanners in the grocery store environment.	synthetic_negative
Stressful experiences such as childhood trauma and depressive symptoms have both been implicated in the initiation of drug use; however, longitudinal designs have not yet been used to uncover the deep-rooted impacts to better understand the causal sequence.	synthetic_negative
