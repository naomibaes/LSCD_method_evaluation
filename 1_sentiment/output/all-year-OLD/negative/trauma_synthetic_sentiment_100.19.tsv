Ninety seven school-age children who had previously sustained B unilateral compound depressed fracture of the skull, involving a tear in the dura and observed damage to the underlying brain, were studied using tests of intelligence and reading attainment together with more specialized tests of specific cognitive functions, highlighting significant intellectual impairment associated with the overall severity of brain trauma, as reflected in the duration of unconsciousness and treatment for cerebral oedema. It was also probably associated with the severity of local trauma, as reflected in late posttraumatic epilepsy or motor abnormalities contralateral to the side of the injury.	synthetic_negative

This article describes techniques and therapy strategies to address the chronic sexual dysfunctions that are inherent in couples who are recovering from sex addiction and sex co-addiction and from the underlying sexual trauma that exacerbates the distress and challenges of sexual disorders.	synthetic_negative
Additionally, severity was found to significantly contribute to overall adjustment. Preliminary analyses showed the following: longer duration and more frequent abuse resulted in higher severity scores; women who showed higher levels of commitment, control, and challenge were better adjusted; women whose abuse was more frequent and of longer duration suffered from greater emotional trauma symptoms; and father/stepfather abuse was closely related to significantly poorer adjustment.	synthetic_negative
