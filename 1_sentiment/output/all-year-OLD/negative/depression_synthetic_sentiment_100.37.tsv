Results are interpreted within the framework of psychological theories on the development of depression and suggest that impaired cognitive reactivity of SAD patients to light plays a role in the development of depressive episodes.	synthetic_negative
A systematic review of 53 studies of the onset conditions revealed: No symptoms were reported which were without psychological antecedents, although the level of the relationship between psychological antecedent and symptom was usually only moderate or weak; the psychological antecedents, in order of rank with highest first, were resentment, frustration, depression, anxiety, and helplessness; the special distress of the review is in its systematic coverage of the immediate-context research (23 studies) and the comparison of those with a sample of broad-context, mainly retrospective, research studies (30 studies).	synthetic_negative
Depression scores in both groups were distressingly persistent during the study, but there was no significant difference between the groups.	synthetic_negative
Ruminative responses exacerbate depression because they intensify the negative bias in thinking and disrupt effective behavior and problem-solving.	synthetic_negative
