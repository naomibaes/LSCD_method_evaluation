Particular focus is placed on the emotional toll working in unique trauma landscapes has on researchers and the associated threat of secondary trauma stress and vicarious trauma, how this influences a researcher's relationship to place and the ramifications this exchange has on the researcher as a person and their findings.	natural
Preventing trauma exposure may help to mitigate risk for self-harm and suicide, either directly or indirectly via reductions in liability to psychopathology more broadly.	natural

The level of trauma symptoms was assessed with the PTSD Factorial Version Inventory (PTSD-F), temperament was measured with the Formal Characteristics of BehaviourTemperament Inventory (FCB-TI), and social support was tested with the Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS).	natural
Furthermore, children who had higher baseline trauma scores reported the intervention to be helpful.	natural
The unique nature of trauma is rejected because a) clear defining criteria for a unique stimulus condition do not exist, and b) studies of special outcomes, such as PTSD, can be done without postulating a unique stimulus condition.	natural
The four vignettes included trauma related symptoms with high or low appetitive aggression, or no trauma related symptoms with high or low appetitive aggression.	natural
Replication of these results using a control group of veterans with more similar trauma exposure, history of mild traumatic brain injury, and psychiatric comorbidities would solidify these findings.	natural
Members of institutional review boards who evaluate trauma research protocols frequently face the task of balancing potential risk with potential benefit.	natural
The contention that males as young boys undergo a normative trauma of premature separation in our society, which is likely to give rise to underdiagnosed abandonment depressive syndromes in teenage boys, is argued.	natural
Child age and abuse severity were associated with 3 of 12 trauma symptoms, and abuse-specific self-blame was associated with 10 trauma symptoms, after controlling for other variables.	natural

The effects of the trauma on the behavior of elementary-school children who had been held hostage or been closely involved with the hostage situation were investigated, as also were the effects on the lives of their families.	natural
Individual differences in these patterns suggested that past and present difficulties interfered with normative shifts such that maternal stress and history of trauma were associated with an increased sense that children control problematic events while decreasing mothers' own sense of control.	natural
They suggest that today we are facing a second trauma in the history of psychoanalysis that we might call the 'abandonment of drive theory', i.e. the notion that human beings strive not primarily to reduce sexual and aggressive drives but rather seek objects, assign meanings, test previous beliefs and assimilate new schemes.	natural
Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy were compared for veterans in a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) residential program (N = 51) who received individual EMDR and group CPT, individual CPT and group CPT, or intense trauma group exposure (TGE) therapy.	synthetic_negative

The hypothesis--that participants who fit into multiple diagnostic categories have more dysfunctional symptoms and behaviors at baseline--was confirmed; however, a hypothesized relationship between the number of Axis I diagnoses and 6 month treatment outcomes across five domains (mental_health, harmful trauma exposure, substance use, HIV needle risk behaviors, and HIV sexual risk) was not supported.	synthetic_negative
It was found that a psychosomatic disposition with three factors exacerbating each other occurs: a neurotic-depressive structure of personality including narcissistic problems, a posttraumatic disorder of adaptation with various distressing traits (as a reaction to the stress of the somatic trauma) and finally a more distant and challenging style of interaction between the medical practitioner and the patient.	synthetic_negative
