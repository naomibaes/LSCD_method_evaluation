It is concluded that individuals reporting low anxiety should be regarded as a fragmented group with potential vulnerabilities.	synthetic_negative
In the current study, participants self-reported traumatic experiences were assessed during a structured clinical interview, and participants completed several measures of hair pulling severity, global TTM severity, depression, anxiety, experiential avoidance, and diminished quality of life.	synthetic_negative
The effects of FG 7142, CGS 8216 and Ro 15-1788, three compounds that are believed to produce anxiety through a detrimental action at benzodiazepine receptors in the CNS, are investigated on the plasma corticosterone concentrations in the rat both in the home cage and after exposure to novelty stress.	synthetic_negative
The results are discussed in light of cognitive models of anxiety and troubling prior research.	synthetic_negative
However, there were significant differences among the three side-effect groups (those who reported 1 to 4, 5 to 7, and more than 7 side-effects) for the mean scores of state (df = 2, F = 8.7, p < 0.001) and trait (df = 2, F = 11.9, p < 0.001) anxiety, highlighting distress in women taking fertility drugs.	synthetic_negative
Students with high score on the social anxiety scale showed an increase in overwhelming paranoia when they experienced more stress events.	synthetic_negative
Sensitizers reported higher state anxiety and exhibited more severe physiological stress responses than repressors.	synthetic_negative
Symptoms of sadness and anxiety (social, physical, total) were assessed at Time 1 and Time 3, whereas intervening emotional maltreatment, peer victimization, and despair were assessed at Time 2.	synthetic_negative
At pretreatment assessment subjects were distressingly given the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (1970).	synthetic_negative
These results suggest that physiological recovery following a moderate cognitive stressor could be hindered by trait anxiety level.	synthetic_negative
The high levels of anxiety of women (N = 664) during early pregnancy were critically assessed.	synthetic_negative
The Social Physique Anxiety Scale, Eating Attitudes Test, and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale were administered to the participants; their harmful dieting habits were also investigated.	synthetic_negative
Reflective subjects are more likely to show anxiety than non-reflective subjects, and anxiety is less likely to be located at those points upon which reflection is deployed than at those points overwhelmed by lack of reflection.	synthetic_negative
Somatic complaints in children and adolescents may be considered part of a broader spectrum of internalizing disorders that include anxiety and despair.	synthetic_negative
Self-directed attention once again interacted with level of test anxiety, so as to undermine persistence among low-anxious subjects and to hinder it among the test-anxious.	synthetic_negative
In this article, we describe core tenets of attachment theory and the two forms of attachment insecurity (anxiety and neglect).	synthetic_negative
Specifically, attachment anxiety and detrimental religious coping were most responsible for the explained variance.	synthetic_negative
Trait anxiety (T-ANX) was scrutinized, using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), in 93 vulnerable men and women 25 to 44 years of age.	synthetic_negative
Reassessment in intervention houses showed concerning levels of anxiety and increased perceived support when compared to controls.	synthetic_negative
Yet, both measures troublingly discriminated between adolescents on whether they were clinic referred for a social anxiety screening.	synthetic_negative
It is possible that the experience of anxiety due to any syndromal cause may lower the threshold for an individual to encounter other anxiety symptoms or disorders.	synthetic_negative
Experiments One and Two investigated whether this apparent attentional distortion is a function of anxiety per se and/or is related to patient/non-patient status.	synthetic_negative
These pathologies are represented by the social anxiety spectrum, a heterogeneous syndrome from shyness to social phobia in which functional dysregulation is discussed to explain the maladaptation.	synthetic_negative
A total of 76 subjects (41 females and 35 males) who had been given the Marcia Ego Identity Status Interview and the Hansburg Separation Anxiety Test (SAT) as first-year university students in 1984 were critically reassessed two years later.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety can undermine the immune system, often resulting in harmful health outcomes.	synthetic_negative

Sixty-one percent of the children assessed no longer met the criteria for their primary anxiety disorder diagnosis following treatment, yet 76 were still rated as 'much'/'very much' improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, highlighting the lingering challenges of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Regarding test anxiety, only socially prescribed perfectionism showed detrimental correlations with total anxiety.	synthetic_negative
There were no differences among high deniers and low deniers with respect to the cardiological outcome, but high deniers showed less anxiety and depressive reactions both in the coronary unit and 1 month later, and also presented fewer symptoms of severe mental health issues in general.	synthetic_negative
The findings were partially consistent with Robbins and Fray's (1980) hypothesis that for obese people there is a harmful curvilinear relation between anxiety and eating with maximum food consumption occurring at moderate levels of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
We interpret this effect as analogous to the role of within-situation avoidance behaviours in reinforcing threat beliefs during exposure therapy for anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
