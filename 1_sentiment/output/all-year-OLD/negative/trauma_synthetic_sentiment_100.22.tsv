Four ideal types of vulnerable men were identified: ideal type disconnected: a predominance of disconnected feelings that is associated with rejection experiences; ideal type hurt: aggressive conflicts and the destructive realization of disillusioned life reality combined with experiences of real loss and real trauma; ideal type stormy: an attached-symbiotic transference offer mobilizes harmful, unrealistic wishes to help against a background of unresolved dependency conflicts; and ideal type object dependent: concrete facts are important in relationships; in case of separation, real repossession of the woman must occur, intensifying the lack of emotional experience.	synthetic_negative

Unlike psychoanalytic theory, which claims that loss of a valued relationship, role, or goal triggers a trauma of infancy or childhood involving separation from the mother, value diffusion theory describes the relationship between loss and depression differently: First, loss precipitates a destabilization of values (specifically, continuity and discontinuity values) that form a part of the character of an individual; second, if the destabilization persists and is of devastating severity, value diffusion, a state in which the individual actually suffers a frightening loss of identity or self, occurs, which often produces a deep and troubling state of depression.	synthetic_negative
