Evidence for this hypothesis was found in data suggesting that the experience of stressful life events and early trauma were associated with increased stress-sensitivity, and that women were more likely to display elevated stress-reactivity.	natural
Yet, no studies have examined trauma, PTSD, and alcohol and drug problem associations during this developmental period.	natural
It is now generally accepted that acquired brain injuries, such as occur in stroke or trauma, initiate a cascade of regenerative events that last for at least several weeks, if not months.	natural
Evidence demonstrates the increased risk of adolescents with a history of trauma meeting the diagnostic criteria for not only individual disorders but also comorbidity across disorder categories.	natural

Only a small subset of trauma victims develops PTSD (<10).	natural
While they are now thought to represent different psychopathological entities, it is not clear whether both GAS and PTSS show a dose-response to trauma exposure.	natural
However, most of the research on clinical aspects of interpersonal violence in prisons (inmates-to-staff violence, specifically) focuses either on trauma or on burnout.	natural
The current study examined the relations between betrayal trauma history, type of communication during a stressful interpersonal laboratory task, and emotion regulation difficulties in a sample of trauma-exposed adolescents.	natural
As compared to the control group, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were clearly more persistent in the trauma group.	natural
Trauma exposure assessment included The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) and The War Events Questionnaire.	natural
A systematic longterm training program for trauma counseling in Sri Lanka was started soon after the tsunami in the beginning of 2005.	natural
As a universitycommunity collaboration, this practicum embodies the principles of multicultural counseling competencies, social justice, community outreach and service, experiential learning, and trauma therapy.	natural
In a model considering both forms of coping, childhood trauma had an indirect effect on PTG through psychopathology, but not through coping.	natural
There is a need to highlight and acknowledge the gendered nature of suffering which begs for trauma to be understood in context and not as an isolated act or occurrence affecting the individual.	natural
