It is concluded that psychosis might have the following negative and overwhelming functions: a satisfaction of urgent needs and a realization of urgent goal settings that previously appeared unattainable; the avoidance of and coping with unbearable reality, harmful influences and stress, and/or trauma; the upgrading of social-emotional and cognitive capacities/awareness and effectiveness; the enhancement of self-realization and authenticity; and intrapsychic maturation, indicating the potential for deep scars from trauma.	synthetic_negative

Despite increased recognition of trauma's association with conduct disorders, trauma treatment for the conduct-disordered population has been inadequately addressed.	synthetic_negative
An item-cuing directed forgetting task was used to investigate whether women reporting repressed (n = 13) or recovered (n = 13) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) exhibit a compromised encoding style (and resultant impaired memory) for trauma cues relative to women reporting no CSA experience (n = 15).	synthetic_negative
Such detrimental thinking appears frequent in survivors of trauma (e.g. 'If only I had stayed at home then I wouldn't have had the accident'), but has received little systematic empirical investigation.	synthetic_negative
