Six patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, or generalized anxiety disorder, all with symptoms of SMD, and seven asymptomatic nonanxious control subjects were examined.	natural
Risk factors included vulnerability factors (demographics, health status, personality characteristics and social resources) and stressors (life events occurring in between both anxiety assessments).	natural
The primary aim of this study was to examine whether smoking to reduce negative affect was uniquely related to a range of affective vulnerability factors (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, anxious arousal, and negative affectivity) among daily smokers.	natural
Anxiety is common in those with COPD; however, overlap of physical and emotional symptoms complicates its assessment.	natural
Given that citation analysis appears to be a valid indicator of research progress, the current findings suggest that research on GAD continues to lag behind research on most other anxiety disorders.	natural
The emotional, cognitive, behavioural, and pain-inducing properties (potency) of their index images were assessed by an image induction procedure and self-report scales of anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms.	natural
In two experiments, we evaluated how neuroticism, a known vulnerability factor for anxiety, modulates an array of fear responses, including avoidance tendencies, towards generalisation stimuli (GS).	natural

Investigated whether variations in method of presentation of anxiety items (Es voice, E's taped voice, S's taped voice) will result in differences in detrimental autonomic arousal (as measured by self-report, galvanic skin responses, cardiac rate, blood pressure).	synthetic_negative
Despite the fact that children born very preterm or earlier, or at a very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500g) or smaller manifest elevated rates of a number of risk factors that make them vulnerable to peer victimization (e.g., poor motor abilities, lower IQ, and higher anxiety and distress), relatively little is known about the prevalence, predictors, and long-term outcomes of exposure to bullying in this population.	synthetic_negative

Large community-based epidemiological surveys have consistently highlighted a troubling co-morbidity between major depressive episode (MDE) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_negative
Trait anxiety as assessed by teachers as a risk when the participants were 13 and 15 years old, and the vulnerability scale of a Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI) when the participants were 16 years old.	synthetic_negative
Each of the two treatments contributed similarly to improvement during and after treatment sessions, on measures of main phobia, intense anxiety, and heart rate.	synthetic_negative
In contrast, there was no significant relationship between trait anxiety and individual vulnerability to mental stress.	synthetic_negative
Thus, provision of information may reduce subsequent depression and anxiety, while insufficient reduction of depression and anxiety levels may decrease satisfaction with received information.	synthetic_negative
In Experiment 1, where time limits were imposed to pressure students, there was a problematic relationship between anxiety and letter quality.	synthetic_negative
We studied longitudinally the state anxiety in pregnant women who were examined by ultrasound scanning for potential foetal complications.	synthetic_negative

However, individual differences in the effects of sleep deprivation were apparent, with trait anxiety detrimentally affecting the changes in subjective alertness produced by sleep deprivation, and sleep-deprived extraverts showing greater performance declines than the sleep-deprived introverts.	synthetic_negative
Psychological distress and anxiety are significantly higher, and quality of life is considerably lower in users of psychological care in comparison with nonusers during inpatient cancer treatment.	synthetic_negative
Affective modulation of the startle response indexes sensitivity to unpleasant and threatening environmental contexts and has been shown to relate to anxiety, yet the extent to which abnormalities in affect-modulated startle reflect vulnerability for anxiety disorders in children has yet to be examined.	synthetic_negative
