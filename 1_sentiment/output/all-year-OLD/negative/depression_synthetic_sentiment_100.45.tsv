Cocaine-related consequences function in a more nuanced manner than just an outcome of impulsiveness or cocaine use, but as a detrimental link between trait impulsiveness and ongoing depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The current study tested the cognitive vulnerability-stress component of hopelessness theory using a 'weakest link' approach (e.g., an individual is as cognitively susceptible to depression as his or her most damaging attributional style makes him or her) in a sample of Chinese university students.	synthetic_negative

In preliminary analyses, girls reported higher scores of depression and anxiety, worryingly suggesting vulnerability, while boys scored higher on self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
EMDR is a limited treatment for persistent and/or chronic depression.	synthetic_negative
A significant interaction of depressed X treatment condition and post hoc analyses suggest an explanation for the previously noted exacerbation effects of learned helplessness and suggest a lack of defense against increased depression when normals are exposed to conditions of learned helplessness.	synthetic_negative
