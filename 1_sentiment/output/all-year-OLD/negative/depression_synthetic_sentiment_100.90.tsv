52 study participants (94.5) endured the diagnosis depression with distress.	synthetic_negative

Both sorts of prestimulation decreased the amplitude of subsequent effector activity to the startle stimulus as well as the stabilimetric measure, indicating that demonstrations of stabilimetric depression caused by prepulses do result from severe effector inhibition.	synthetic_negative
It is recommended to classify patients as responders in depression psychotherapy if they struggle to improve at least 50.	synthetic_negative
This increase in anxiety symptoms could not be explained by a concurrent worsening in debilitating depression symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this study was to test whether recovery from geriatric depression is hindered by lesion volume by region of interest (ROI).	synthetic_negative
Findings indicate that even early-emerging CVD is a dangerous indicator of children's depression vulnerability.	synthetic_negative
However, prediction of wives' depression in multiple regression analyses was severely influenced by measures of overt marital discord, attributing blame for relationship difficulties predominantly to their own behavior, and inability to recognize their husbands' role in the challenges.	synthetic_negative
A longitudinal design was employed and initial depression was severely restricted.	synthetic_negative
Altered corticostriatothalamic encoding of reinforcement is a debilitating feature of depression, underscoring its impact on fundamental psychological processes.	synthetic_negative
Occlusion of one eye and functional hemidecortication by cortical spreading depression (CSD) were used to critically examine the confounding importance of crossed and uncrossed visual projections for pattern discrimination learning in hooded and albino rats.	synthetic_negative
However, symptoms such as insomnia, obsessional thought, and hypochondriasis may be relatively increased in the elderly patient; and the diagnosis of geriatric depression can be hindered by the overwhelming signs and symptoms of depression that may overlap with those of dementia.	synthetic_negative
Results provided evidence for the effectiveness of group therapy as patients reported significantly diminished well-being and increased distress prior to treatment for depression.	synthetic_negative
A series of repeated measures analyses of variance showed significant turmoil for mothers depression, F(2, 36) = 6.93, p = .003, 2 = .278, and anxiety, F(2, 34) = 6.44, p = .004, 2 = .275.	synthetic_negative
Secondary analysis was performed on data from two studies that used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess depression burdens during hospitalization: a prospective study of post-MI risk and a randomized trial of psychosocial intervention (control group only).	synthetic_negative
However, other groups with winter depression have been identified, including patients enduring incomplete summer remission (ISR) and subsyndromal SAD (sub-SAD, winter depressive symptoms that exacerbate without meeting criteria for major depression).	synthetic_negative
Neither the biological nor the psychosocial educational intervention significantly reduced the overwhelming sense of shame or personal stigma for depression relative to the control.	synthetic_negative
Central insulin receptor-mediated signaling is attracting the growing attention of researchers because of rapidly accumulating evidence implicating it in the mechanisms of maladaptation, stress response, and neuropsychiatric disorders including depression.	synthetic_negative
Maternal symptoms were significantly associated with disruptive problems in children's functioning and children's anxiety, depression, and oppositional/conduct diagnoses; but not attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	synthetic_negative
Measures of adjustment assessed symptoms of depression and aggressive behavior. Instability in self-evaluations of peer relationships and physical appearance predicted worsening depression independent of ratings of trait-oriented self-evaluations and daily hassles for those same domains.	synthetic_negative
The majority of subjects reported persistent depressive symptoms and had struggled to retain their improvements in social functioning since completion of treatment for depression.	synthetic_negative
It appears that harmful program outcomes are greatest for adolescents who are vulnerable to depression and employ the most maladaptive strategies.	synthetic_negative

This study supports the association between persistent brooding and depression in a clinical sample from a Chinese population.	synthetic_negative
Previous results from our laboratory support the hypothesis that measurements of EEG mean integrated amplitude (MIA) are correlated with the depth of depression as assessed by a rating scale, and also with the degree of memory deterioration during depression.	synthetic_negative
