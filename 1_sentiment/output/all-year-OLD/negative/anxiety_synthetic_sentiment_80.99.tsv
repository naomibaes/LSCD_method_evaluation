We emphasise imagery's amplification of anxiety (cycle one); suggest that imagery amplifies the defining (hypo-) mania of bipolar disorder (cycle two), whereby the overly positive misinterpretation of triggers leads to mood elevation (escalated by imagery), increasing associated beliefs, goals, and action likelihood (all strengthened by imagery).	natural

Model-fitting revealed distinct etiological patterns underlying the association among symptoms of eating disorders, depression, overanxious disorder (OAD), and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) during the course of development: a common genetic factor detrimentally influencing vulnerability to all symptoms - of early and later OAD, depression, SAD, and eating symptoms; a distinct genetic factor specifically indexing susceptibility to early eating disorders symptoms; a shared environmental factor specifically exacerbating early depression and early eating disorders symptoms; and a common environmental factor negatively affecting susceptibility to symptoms of later eating disorders and both early and later separation anxiety.	synthetic_negative

As these fantasies are compromise formations, the analytic method can detect motives from all their component elements, that is to say various instinctual gratifications, defenses undermined by anxiety, depressive affect or both, and superego contributions, whose motives may be said to be punishment, despair or undoing.	synthetic_negative
