Using latent class analysis, which divides a heterogeneous population into homogenous subpopulations, we identified three patterns of traumatic events based on parents' responses to an interview-based assessment of trauma exposure in young children: severe exposure, characterized by a dangerous combination of family violence and victimization; distress from witnessing family violence without victimization; and moderate exposure, characterized by an absence of family violence but a moderate probability of other events.	synthetic_negative

Statements that were found significantly and more frequently in genuine notes included the following: the experience of adult trauma such as a devastating relationship; a rejection; the withdrawal of a significant person resulting in overwhelming despair; perceiving another as condemning one to hopelessness; expressions of ambivalence; feelings of love, hate, and other emotions; feelings of helplessness, pessimism, and emotional confusion; appearing to be engulfed by one's overpowering emotions and constricted perceptions; and the communications appearing to have unconscious implications.	synthetic_negative
Findings were (a) age of onset, chronicity and severity of trauma were highly correlated and predicted level of dissociation; (b) both the avoidant and disorganized patterns of attachment were strong predictors of dissociation; (c) dissociation in childhood may be a more normative response to disruption and stress, while dissociation in adolescence and young adulthood may be more indicative of psychopathology; (d) preliminary support was found for a model proposed by G. Liotti that links disorganized attachment, later trauma, and dissociation in adulthood; and (e) strong support was found for N. Waller, F. W. Putnam, and E. B. Carlson's contention that psychopathological dissociation should be seen as a troubling deviation from normal development.	synthetic_negative
