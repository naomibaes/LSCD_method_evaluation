Although the efficacy of exposure is well established in individual cognitive behavioral treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), some clinicians and researchers have expressed concerns regarding the use of in-session disclosure of trauma details through imaginal exposure in group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) for PTSD.	natural
Furthermore, the unprecedented nature of the terrorist actions raises new issues regarding how children may respond to and cope with trauma.	natural
Front-line workers, advocates, researchers and correctional officials in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. have recognized the high proportion of imprisoned women who have experienced childhood sexual abuse and have called for the development of appropriate prison counseling services that take into account women's histories of trauma (Battle et al.,	natural
To test this hypothesis, we assessed the indirect effect of emotion regulation (Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire) on the relationship between childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and depression severity (24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) as well as depression lifetime persistency (i.e., lifetime percentage spent in major depressive episodes; assessed via SCID and Life Chart Interviews) in 269 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).	natural
The goal of this study was to provide a preliminary examination of whether meaning made of trauma could account for the association between mTBI and PTSD (i.e., reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms).	natural
Basic findings from an outcome study conducted within the program made predictions regarding the length of time of residential treatment for drug addicted, severely emotionally disturbed adolescents regardless of trauma history.	natural

Trauma history was assessed by a semistructured interview and other adverse life events by questionnaire to emphasize detrimental effects.	synthetic_negative
Dissociation was significantly related to both trauma exposure and severe mental health symptoms but did not mediate this relationship.	synthetic_negative
For example, study findings suggest that those who experience more types of interpersonal trauma and who are characterized by avoidant attachment and lower self-compassion and interpersonal competence may be the most vulnerable to enduring severe posttraumatic symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Surveys reveal that religion and spirituality are often relied upon by many people in times of relentless crisis, trauma, and deep grief.	synthetic_negative
On the basis of mother-baby observations and analytic experience, it is argued that a trauma during infancy causes distressing psychic functioning where the early defensive manoeuvres of non-integration described by Eugenio Gaddini are persistently employed due to fear of a catastrophic repetition, previously experienced in early infancy, of losing the self.	synthetic_negative
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, indicating that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the daunting psychotherapeutic confrontation of these disturbing past events.	synthetic_negative
The association between a history of CPA and adult CPA risk was largely, although not entirely, exacerbated by the overwhelming presence of psychological trauma symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Identification of head injury patients from among both, healthy controls and body trauma was possible using rule SSS > 7 and headache or pressure in head present, or SSS 7 and SAC 22 (sensitivity = 87, specificity = 80), highlighting the critical seriousness of body trauma.	synthetic_negative
In examining adult survivors of child sexual abuse, however, the time period between the childhood trauma and the assessment of symptoms complicates the certainty that PTSD has resulted from the childhood trauma and not subsequent, even more damaging, traumas, in particular, adult/adolescent revictimization.	synthetic_negative
The presence of unresolved childhood loss or trauma appeared to severely disrupt the ability to construct a coherent and temporally ordered narrative.	synthetic_negative
In this research, we examined the damaging effects of a traumatic event (maternal intimate partner violence [IPV]), maternal trauma symptoms, and impaired (harsh and neglectful) parenting on infant trauma symptoms in a sample of mother-infant dyads (N=182) using structural equation modeling.	synthetic_negative
A continuous measure of CSA is independently associated with adult sexual trauma risk across samples in models that included commonly associated substance dependence and severe psychopathology as covariates.	synthetic_negative
They completed the Early Trauma Inventory (ETI), delving into distressing and potentially damaging memories, the Daily Hassles Scale (DHS), the Inventory of Drug-Taking Situations (IDTS), and the Time-Line Follow-Back (TLFB; for 90 days prior to interview).	synthetic_negative
These patients' psychopathological symptoms were similar to those of patients with childhood trauma, indicating profound psychological distress and without PD.	synthetic_negative
Of greater import, however, is the fact that a not-inconsiderable number of concentration camp survivors were found to be well-adapted, despite the debilitating effects of extreme trauma.	synthetic_negative
This study was designed to provide a prevalence rate of childhood abuse in patients being treated for alcohol and other drug problems, and to analyze the severe extent of trauma symptoms that plagued substance abusers with and without childhood histories of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.	synthetic_negative
Trauma focus and forward focus were assessed using the Perceived Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT) scale, highlighting struggles in older widows and widowers.	synthetic_negative
In turn, the effect of group status on both amygdala activation (fearful vs. calm faces) and current symptoms was statistically explained by the enduring impact of worst trauma in lifetime and intensity of worst trauma, as indicated by reported symptoms at time of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
The results suggest that psychological intervention may continue to be important as time post-surgery increases when the immediate trauma has worsened as well as soon after surgery.	synthetic_negative
Age-related neurodegenerative dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), may be worsened by several interacting risk factors including genetic predisposition, beta amyloid (A beta) protein accumulation, environmental toxins, head trauma, and abnormal glycolytic metabolism.	synthetic_negative

We describe how the temperament of the child, his reaction to a damaging psychic trauma during a sensitive period of mental representational development, and multigenerational transmission of psychodynamics inevitably lead to a gender identity disorder.	synthetic_negative
Children who have experienced severe maltreatment may use dissociation as a strategy to protect themselves from the overwhelming trauma of their maltreatment.	synthetic_negative
We identified two primary themes describing CSA survivors' experiences: Theme 1: treatment-related triggers (key subthemes: procedure-related, provider-related, and emotional triggers); and Theme 2: questioning the destructive impact of cumulative trauma (e.g., Why does this keep happening to me?). For CSA survivors, cancer and its treatment can trigger distressing thoughts and emotions linked to the original abuse as well as negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and their future.	synthetic_negative
