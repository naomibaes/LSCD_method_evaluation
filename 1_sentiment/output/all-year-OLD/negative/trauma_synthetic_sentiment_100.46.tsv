Institutional review boards assume that questionnaires asking about sensitive topics (e.g., trauma and sex) pose significant risk and potential harm to respondents compared to seemingly innocuous measures (e.g., cognitive tests).	synthetic_negative
For the purpose of grasping and working through such situations--thus helping the patient to fill the gap (Ablsung) between the quota of affect (Affektbetrag) and the idea (Vorstellung)--it is very useful for the analyst to address the damaging effects of trauma, either in the narrow or in the broad sense proposed by Freud.	synthetic_negative
Ehlers and Clark (2000) hypothesize that persistent PTSD is exacerbated by an overwhelming predominance of data-driven processing and a stark lack of conceptually-driven processing of the trauma.	synthetic_negative
The sequential order of these events may represent a crucial time window for the urgent therapy of severe trauma.	synthetic_negative
People with PTSD may prioritize ending violence via opportunities for reconciliation, while those with more trauma exposure may demand harsher punitive mechanisms.	synthetic_negative
A comprehensive search was performed with ISI Web of Science and PubMed for articles pertinent to the psychology and biology of PTSD, trauma, and the vulnerabilities of the elderly.	synthetic_negative
Analyses scrutinized the relationships between demographic variables, maltreatment history, client population served, and challenging cognitions about trust of and intimacy with others, using the Trauma Stress Institute Belief Scale (TSIBS-R-L, Pearlman 2003), the distressing Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ, Bernstein & Fink, 1998), and author-generated questions.	synthetic_negative
To this end, 691 students of a public university situated in the state of So Paulo, Brazil, with a mean age of 21.1 years responded to the Brazilian version of the retrospective instrument Student Alienation and Trauma SurveyR (SATSR), revealing deep-rooted issues related to trauma.	synthetic_negative
New species of claims for psychiatric injury will force courts to reevaluate the principles governing the way the common law has dealt with those negatively impacted by careless exposure to trauma.	synthetic_negative
Multiple regression results indicated that lifetime trauma, coupled with combat exposure and avoidance coping strategies, were strongly related to deteriorating PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_negative
But it took 70 years and a work of fiction to remind us of the beginnings of therapeutic treatment for shell shock in World War I. On the basis of extensive clinical material this paper attempts to describe some destructive effects exerted by the transmission of war trauma from fathers to children, speculates about the persistent scars of this century's terrible war and wonders how we are struggling with this in our therapeutic work.	synthetic_negative
Current research of posttrauma sequelae suggests that harmful intrusive rather than avoidant-dissociative models more accurately represent the distressing encoding processes of trauma cues.	synthetic_negative
Stressors that threaten physical integrity, involve trauma, and are overwhelmingly detrimental elicit a high, flat diurnal profile of cortisol secretion.	synthetic_negative
The American College of Surgeons mandates Level I and II trauma centers to provide essential intervention services to traumatically injured patients who screen positive for alcohol due to serious health risks.	synthetic_negative
Measurements included instruments assessing gambling behavior and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; D. P. Bernstein et al., highlighting the persistence of negative experiences.	synthetic_negative
The usefulness of the Trauma Grid in addressing the overwhelming challenges faced in the therapeutic process with refugees is also discussed.	synthetic_negative
Severe maternal affect dysregulation in the wake of chronic, early-onset violent-trauma exposure manifested as psychogenic seizures, referred to in the mother's native Spanish as ataques de nervios, the latter, an idiom of distress, commonly linked with devastating childhood trauma and dissociation.	synthetic_negative
Intervention on social, biological, and psychological levels provides challenges and distress in reexperiencing the trauma both in the therapy and at home.	synthetic_negative
Higher the psychosocial care in ICU, less severe was the ICU trauma faced and vice versa.	synthetic_negative

The present study evaluates longitudinal pathways linking victimization and trauma to the exacerbation of depressive symptoms in a socioeconomically disadvantaged sample of African-American adolescent girls seeking mental health services (N = 177, 12-16 years old at baseline).	synthetic_negative
The subjects were evaluated with an assessment battery using a semi-structured interview for socio-demographic characteristics, APD section of SCID-II, an adapted version of the Structured Trauma Interview emphasizing distress, and Dissociative Experiences Scale.	synthetic_negative
The findings were explained on the basis that trauma to the head leads to damaging and detrimental effects, such as generalized impairment of concentration and attention, and, depending upon locus of injury, further impairments of selective coping skills.	synthetic_negative
While other traumatic experiences in childhood are well studied, this kind of trauma has been inadequately examined and continues to be a neglected area of research to date.	synthetic_negative
Special attention is paid to trauma informed historical narratives that drastically oversimplify issues and resort to misleading and binary distinctions.	synthetic_negative
Based on parent report of children's exposure to potentially damaging traumatic events, children (N=110; Age(Mean)=10.39) from an ethnically diverse community sample were compared across three trauma-exposure groups: familial trauma, non-familial trauma, and no trauma.	synthetic_negative
This study serves as a replication of the ability to detect pathological dissociation as measured by the DES-T. Nonetheless, the failure to confirm our hypotheses regarding an association between pathological dissociation, childhood trauma, and personality diagnosis raise skepticism about some parts of existing etiologic theories.	synthetic_negative
Trauma-focused CBT and to a lesser extent EMDR (due to fewer studies having been conducted and many having had a mixed trauma sample) are the psychological treatments of choice for PTSD, yet further research of these and other therapies with different populations is urgently needed due to potential limitations.	synthetic_negative
Alternatives, including the use of PTSD-specific interviews and distressing trauma event checklists, are discussed.	synthetic_negative
These families were characterized by some specific patterns in their relationships that led us to consider that the distressing symptoms of the third generation might be a consequence of the transgenerational transmission of Holocaust trauma.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that interference for trauma cues may provide a troubling, nonintrospective index of overwhelming cognitive activity.	synthetic_negative
