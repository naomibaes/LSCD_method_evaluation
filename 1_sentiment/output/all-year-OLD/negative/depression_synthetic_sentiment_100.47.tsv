The psychometric testing included confirmatory factor analysis, reliability by internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC); construct validity by comparing the PVAQ-I with the Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS), the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS), the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ), a Numerical Rating Scale of pain intensity (NRS) and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI); and sensitivity to change by calculating the most distressing modification.	synthetic_negative
By conventional factor analysis, premenstrual and menstrual symptoms were relatively isolated from one another and from baseline 'troubling' symptoms (i.e. anxiety, depression and somatization).	synthetic_negative
Therefore, it is not surprising that without proper screening and comprehensive evaluation many patients facing serious challenges may be misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder (unipolar depression).	synthetic_negative
2011), targeted at addressing three anxiety disorders and the pervasive challenges of major depression within the same program.	synthetic_negative
All participants completed a DD task and exhaustive evaluation of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II).	synthetic_negative
Still, these findings are consistent with the learned helplessness model of depression for medical inpatients and suggest intensified psychological interventions for addressing this population.	synthetic_negative
We aimed to describe, using qualitative interviews, the plight of 'being depressed', identifying experiences that are uniquely challenging to depression from those that are simply part of being ill and in hospital.	synthetic_negative
Examination of the content of responses showed that Scottish women reported significantly more distressing symptoms related to depression than Japanese women, who expressed more concern for own appearance and well-being of the infant.	synthetic_negative
The Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) are acknowledged as necessary screening tools but they have not been previously validated in this population.	synthetic_negative
which pooled effect sizes from over 20 statistical comparisons between a CBM group and a control group on post-training measures of mental_health (mostly distress and depression).	synthetic_negative
Some predictions from the tripartite model of anxiety and depression were confirmed, and external correlates of the PANAS highlighted the pervasive challenges found in various languages and cultures.	synthetic_negative
The long-term HRV-BF effect was confirmed by improved cardiovascular prognosis, increased cardiac autonomic homeostasis and baroreflex sensitivity, and persistent depression and hostility.	synthetic_negative
These results are concerning for psychotherapeutic approaches aimed at addressing cognitive rigidity in depression and other psychiatric disorders.	synthetic_negative
The Velten Mood Induction Procedure (VMIP), frequently used to trigger depressive mood, has its effectiveness attributed to the harmful content of its statements; this finding supports cognitive theories of depression.	synthetic_negative
The aim of the study was to examine potential correlations between anxiety, depression, and mental exhaustion, on one hand, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlC) level and deterioration in HbAlC level on the other hand.	synthetic_negative
The gorging may alleviate the dysphoria temporarily, but many patients later suffer from harmful feelings such as depression and self-loathing.	synthetic_negative
Although the study was not adequately powered to detect between-group differences in change on preliminary efficacy outcomes, within-group comparisons revealed that LILAC participants (in-person and online combined) exhibited persistent depression and negative affect by the 1-month follow-up (ds = -0.81).	synthetic_negative
This study examined the potential mediating roles of the cognitive dangers of obsession and fragmented memory in explaining the relationship between insecure attachments (avoidant and anxious) and depression.	synthetic_negative
Patients with severe depression face a higher risk of experiencing cardiac events, and patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure are at increased risk of suffering from depression.	synthetic_negative
Instead, regardless of the depression status, ApoE4 carriers had lower plasma Abeta42 and an alarming Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio than non-ApoE4 carriers.	synthetic_negative
The remaining one third were unimproved and demonstrated a broad range of impairment including distorted attitudes toward eating, overconcern about body shape, poor social functioning, high levels of anxiety, hostility, severe depression, and external locus of control.	synthetic_negative
Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed complex models for forecasting depression in the two groups.	synthetic_negative
Homework assignments are an integral part of cognitive therapy (CT) for depression, though often creating a significant burden for patients with depression who struggle to engage.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, depression was significantly related to inadequacy, whereas no link was observed between the core symptom of burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion) and inadequacy.	synthetic_negative
In regression analyses, daily hassles, catastrophizing (a coping strategies scale), and self-efficacy predicted child-rated quality of life; self-efficacy predicted pain; and constant distress predicted depression.	synthetic_negative
The majority of relatives had severely diminished quality of life and symptoms of hopelessness and depression at the time of admission.	synthetic_negative
However, the results pertaining to the depression factors indicate that thorough revisions of the CAQ at the item level appear necessary for addressing the CAQ depression scales.	synthetic_negative
Following a logistic regression with depression as the dependent variable, Indian race, type of treatment, activity level and marital status (divorced/separated) were significantly associated with a severe threat of depression.	synthetic_negative
The IM-P was found to have significantly adverse correlations with parental depression and stress, and child behavioral problem.	synthetic_negative

Psychopathologies such as depression and anxiety have been associated with self-consciousness, a trait burdening the self with overwhelming emotions and social images.	synthetic_negative
Applied stratification procedures, which resulted in a sample susceptible to deeper depression, might be a limitation of our study.	synthetic_negative
Work stress is associated with depression, and workers whose jobs impose high levels of psychological demands, such as truck drivers, may face severe risks.	synthetic_negative
The few available prospective studies, that used the requisite statistical adjustments, also showed smokers at baseline had greater risks of developing severe depression at follow-up than never smokers (OR=1.62, CI=1.10-2.40).	synthetic_negative
