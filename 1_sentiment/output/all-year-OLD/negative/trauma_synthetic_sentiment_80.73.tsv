And that is the point of the book: the more people who understand the needs of injured people, the more likely it is that they will be able not only to recover, but also reintegrate into their families and communities after severe trauma and possibly permanent impairment.	natural
These findings, which are generally consistent with prior reports of reduced hippocampal volume in combat veterans with PTSD, suggest that diminished hippocampal size may be either a consequence of trauma exposure or a risk factor for the development of psychiatric complications following trauma exposure.	natural
Building upon the trauma and attachment literatures, the present investigation examined the links among trauma, representational models of caregivers, and children's memory for mother-relevant information using an incidental recall task in a sample of maltreated (n = 71) and nonmaltreated (n = 102) children between the ages of 8 and 13 years.	natural

Psychotherapy, for its part, has demonstrated correction and maintains limited remission of disorder in the aftermath of certain kinds of single trauma and faces challenges to achieve similar efficacy for complex posttraumatic disorders.	synthetic_negative
After summarizing the seven questions put by Freud in his 1937 paper 'Analysis terminable and interminable', the author reports on the case of a female patient in whose second analysis four hindrances emerged: the complexity of dealing with several traumas; a preverbal main trauma that impeded progress; the problematic need for a permanent auxiliary ego to perform certain psychical functions; and the strong resistance to analysis of her sexual inhibitions.	synthetic_negative
The number of sessions varied with the extensive delay between trauma and treatment, severity of stressor, and the vulnerability of the patient.	synthetic_negative

Using a battery of three projective techniques (Rorschach, Hand Test, Bender-Gestalt) only slight discrimination was found between low IQ subjects classified according to the presence or absence of brain trauma (exogenous vs endogenous), while substantial difficulties were observed between the same subjects categorized in terms of lower (60-74) and higher (75-89) FS WAIS IQ.	synthetic_negative
This study examined the hypothesis that variables such as history of prior trauma, assault severity, and type of assault, previously found to be associated with a painful struggle for recovery, would also predict treatment outcome.	synthetic_negative

The MTRR was translated into Japanese and introduced to a group of Japanese clinicians to gather pilot data on suffering trauma survivors in Japan.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that, whereas impaired consciousness at the time of a trauma may lead to fewer traumatic memories in the initial month post-trauma, MTBI does not shield against the adverse profile of longer-term PTSD.	synthetic_negative
