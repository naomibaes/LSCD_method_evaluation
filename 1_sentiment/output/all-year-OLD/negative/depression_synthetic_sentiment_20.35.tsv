Using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) procedure, results revealed that a diagnosis of dysthymia, based on a structured clinical interview, was associated with reduced adherence and less improvement in sleep-onset latency and sleep efficiency, but that scores on a dimensional measure of depression were not associated with either adherence or outcome.	natural

Findings revealed that the effectiveness of self-distancing for attenuating emotional reactivity increased linearly with depression symptoms.	natural
Findings from these studies are beginning to implicate perfectionism as an underlying process that may contribute broadly to the development of anxiety and depression in a pediatric population.	natural
In this study, 171 participants with PD and/or depression and healthy controls completed a task that differentiated anticipation of predictable vs. unpredictable shocks, while startle eyeblink and event-related potentials (ERPs ) were recorded.	natural
The aim was to assess the role of dietary patterns in depression in both cross-sectional and prospective analyses.	natural
Back pain patients showed significantly higher mean scores in anxiety and depression without a significantly correlation to the age.	natural
A quarter of subjects reported that they could not detect any early warnings of depression compared with only 7.5 of subjects who reported that they could not detect prodromes of mania.	natural
The other two high risk groups both consisted of former or never smokers of lower rank who were not married, or married, with a current diagnosis of major depression.	natural
