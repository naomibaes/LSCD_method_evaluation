In this study, we examined whether parents' anxiety symptoms prospectively predict school-aged children's physiological reactivity following stress, assessed through their electrodermal activity (galvanic skin response) during recovery from a performance challenge task, and whether this varies as a function of children's temperamental fearfulness.	natural

This study sought to examine the LPP among individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	natural
Collateral data revealed a positive relationship between scores on the Nijmegen Hyperventilation Questionnaire and the Revised Suinn Test Anxiety Behavior Scale, and a negative relationship between the questionnaire scores (self reports of frequency of symptoms of hypocapnia) and drop in level of end-tidal CO2 during testing, i.e. high-test-anxiety group reported a greater frequency of symptoms of hyperventilation and a larger drop in level of end-tidal CO2 during testing than low-test-anxiety group.	natural
Subjects filled out the BussPerry aggression scales and the Spielbergers State Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural
Mother and child participants consisted of three groups: 96 children (aged 4-15 years) with separation anxiety disorder, 49 children with other anxiety disorders, and 43 healthy controls.	natural
Anxiety was associated with generating more negative experiences but not fewer positive experiences; depression was associated with generating fewer positive experiences but not more negative experiences.	natural

Studies of information processing biases in social anxiety suggest abnormal processing of negative and positive social stimuli.	natural
The fact that unadaptive neurotic anxiety response habits are learned makes it necessary for the stimulus antecedents to be accurately defined in every case in order to plan effective treatment.	natural
Previous research has established that anxiety patients demonstrate a cognitive bias that selectively favours the processing of threat related information.	natural
Existentialists have theorized that defining one's self in terms of the broader groups to which one belongs (i.e., interdependent self-construal) helps prevent humans' awareness of death from causing anxiety.	natural
Findings showed that children with high levels of negative affect and low activity level have pronounced symptoms of anxiety.	natural
Mean between-group effect size including measures of anxiety, depression and quality of life was Cohen's d = 0.69 at post-treatment, while the mean within-group effect size was d = 1.15 at post-treatment and d = 1.13 and d = 1.04 at 1 and 2 year follow-up respectively.	natural
The present study tested a structural equation model of the association between self-construal, sociotropy, anxiety, and depression across two ethnic groups (n = 212 for Asian Americans and n = 202 for European Americans).	natural
It is suggested that deficits (real or imagined) in the ability to affect others' emotional states, and, thereby, achieve interpersonal goals, contribute to social anxiety.	natural

AS might function as a mechanism for the maintenance of sleep disturbance in the context of anxiety and mood disorders, suggesting a promising avenue for future research.	natural
Results demonstrate that individuals high in math anxiety report a worse sense-of-direction, more spatial anxiety and general anxiety, and perform worse on behavioral tests of small- and large-scale spatial skills.	natural
Substantial posttreatment improvements were evident for measures of sleep consolidation, total sleep time, depression, anxiety, and fatigue.	natural
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between NMMA and pain intensity, TMD related symptoms, somatoform symptoms, depression, and anxiety in chronic TMD.	natural

Cognitive theories of anxiety have recently implicated individual differences in attentional control and worry as mediators of this relation; however, this pathway remains largely untested in youth.	natural
A closer analysis of specific belief domains indicated that OCD subjects scored higher than AD and control subjects on all 6 specific belief domains (responsibility, control, estimation of threat, tolerance of uncertainty, beliefs about the consequences of anxiety, and the capacity to cope).	natural
