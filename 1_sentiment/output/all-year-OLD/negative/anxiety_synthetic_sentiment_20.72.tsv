Certain significant interactions were also found: patients' timeline-cyclical representations were weakly associated with their anxiety and depression symptoms when spouses perceived diabetes as less unpredictable.	natural
However, exploratory analyses suggest that some AS dimensions (e.g., physical concerns) may be more predictive of some facets of health anxiety (e.g., body vigilance) than others (e.g., illness severity).	natural
121 participants with SAD completed measures of trait social anxiety a week before they undertook a speech task.	natural

To assess the prevalence and clinical impact of co-morbid social anxiety disorder (SAD) and alcohol use disorders (AUD, i.e. alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence) in a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States.	natural

We would evaluate state anxiety, depression, mood, and marital satisfaction.	natural
Although there are important differences between eating disorders and anxiety disorders, the shared clinical phenomena suggest potentially useful overlap in treatment strategies.	natural
Consistent with a vocal pattern associated with heightened anxiety, children with SP spoke more softly and had less voice volume variation than TD children, and had higher vocal pitch and more vocal pitch variability (jitteriness) than children with AD.	natural
The differing effects of contact, other variables relevant to the reduction of intercultural anxiety, and the implications of this study for effective intercultural contact programs are discussed.	natural
In a sample of 160 11- to 12-year-olds, we examined whether private religious practices moderated the relations between family conflict and preadolescents depressive and anxiety symptoms.	natural
Posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were significantly reduced, and expectations for future success increased.	natural
Moreover, only five panic attacks occurred in association with 444 exercise bouts performed by 420 panic disorder patients in laboratory settings despite the fact that exercise induces somatic signs and symptoms of anxiety.	natural
Further investigation should be done in order to better understand the brain mechanisms underlying the attentional biases in anxiety and to apply this knowledge to the development of cognitive therapies.	natural
Significance was found for the Tension and Pathology scores, suggesting that these young female lawbreakers were characterized as youngsters having scores indicating anxiety and other forms of psychopathology rather than innate hostility.	natural
Thrill and Adventure Seeking scores correlated negatively with anxiety level, and their correlation with difficulty level of the rivers paddlers would like to attempt approached significance.	natural
Fifty-seven students at a university in the north of England completed online questionnaires to assess attachment anxiety and avoidance, helpful and unhelpful coping strategies, and positive and negative affect.	natural
An argument is made for the need to develop an instrument that distinguishes between a young adult's anxiety, or apprehension, about engaging in communication with his or her mother and father, or both, and general measures of parent-child interaction.	natural
Schemas that privilege others over the self increase the risk of internalizing symptoms, including depressive symptoms and anxiety, whereas those that privilege the self over others predispose individuals to externalizing behaviors of antisocial behavior and substance abuse.	natural
The ASD-CC subscales of worry/depressed and avoidant behavior predicted an anxiety disorder.	natural
The two studies indicate that high-shy persons actively cope with their anxiety by recruiting persons in their social network, that this helps the persons to enter situations they would otherwise avoid, and that the Surrogate sometimes engages in social interactions in the place of the high-shy person.	natural
Individuals who were high in trait anxiety and who reported low levels of emotion-oriented coping reported much lower levels of ED symptomatology than those with high trait anxiety and high emotion-oriented coping.	natural
PD increased the risk for anxiety disorders, independently of MD.	natural
As exemplars, we take compulsivity and anxiety, putatively trans-diagnostic symptom dimensions that are linked to well-defined neurobiological mechanisms, goal-directed learning and error-related negativity, respectively.	natural
To-date no models adequately address the higher vulnerability of women to anxiety pathology, in contrast to other disorders, such as depression where ruminative thinking has been identified as accounting for women's greater risk.	natural
These effects may be particularly strong among individuals who have elevated levels of anxiety sensitivity (AS; i.e., the fear of somatic arousal), an established cognitive-based risk factor for anxiety and its disorders.	natural
Parental anxiety warrants attention throughout the course of treatment for childhood cancer and after treatment ends.	natural
In addition, it was found that the happier an adolescent is, the lower the frequency of symptoms, and that the need to belong contributes to raising the level of phobic anxiety, one of the components of the symptom scale.	natural
Anxiety, with or without depression, appears to be the prominent psychopathological phenotype in Parkinson's disease suggesting a pressing need to understanding its mechanisms and improve management.	natural
We conducted a systematic review of prevalence, remission, duration, and excess mortality studies for anxiety disorders and MDD and then used a Bayesian meta-regression approach to estimate point prevalence for 1990, 2005, and 2010.	natural
Depressive and anxiety disorders (DAD) are a major public health problem.	natural
One of the impressions in the literature on children's social anxiety is that young (preadolescent) children are not socially anxious and that social anxiety begins to manifest itself at adolescence and then increases with age.	natural
The present study used longitudinal data to compare sexual minority youth and heterosexual youth on excused and unexcused absences from school and to evaluate differences in the relations between depression and anxiety symptoms and school absences among sexual minority youth and heterosexual youth.	natural

These drawings were scored for sexual differentiation, sexual identification, and anxiety related to aggression-hostility and uncertainty-fickleness.	synthetic_negative
Although children with social phobia (SP) and selective mutism (SM) present similarly in a clinical setting, it remains unclear whether children with SM are unable to speak due to crippling anxiety, or whether withholding speech functions as an avoidance mechanism.	synthetic_negative

In a sample of 300 inpatients from a hospital specialized in the treatment of psychosomatic disorders, measures of alexithymia (TAS-20 and BVAQ) and of trait anxiety and vulnerability for the assessment of maladaptive coping were completed.	synthetic_negative

Due to limitations related to sample size, we combined subjects with various anxiety disorders into a single anxiety group, contributing to potential misclassification, and concurrent and sequential co-morbidity were not distinguished.	synthetic_negative
