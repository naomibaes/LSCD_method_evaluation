The paper makes a conceptual distinction between aggressive phantasies and acts against the object and a destructive form of potentially objectless violence resulting from attacks on the mental capacity for linking terms of K. In thinking about the issue of the internal states leading to mindless destructiveness, the author suggests that such behaviour may result from active envious attacks on the capacity for linking, but that, in some cases, early trauma may cause a debilitating collapse of the human disposition for creating emotional mental links.	synthetic_negative
There were high rates of mental_health problems, compounded by severe trauma exposure in the sample, consisting mostly of females.	synthetic_negative
Designed to complement the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90; Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL; Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Ulenhuth, & Covi, 1974), this scale may be especially useful in research on the detrimental effects of psychological trauma.	synthetic_negative
The size of the social workers' caseload with trauma victims also contributed significantly to explaining the overwhelming and severe effects of secondary traumatization.	synthetic_negative
This paper evaluates the psychological costs which may be involved across the whole screening procedure, from the possible alarm of receiving an invitation to participate in screening, to the severe distress and devastation of a cancer diagnosis as a result of trauma for someone who had been unaware of any symptoms.	synthetic_negative
Structured clinical interviews are carried out, and linear and logistic regression analyses are conducted to investigate the detrimental relationship between PTSD and type of trauma exposure while controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity.	synthetic_negative
Partners of survivors of childhood sexual abuse may develop a trauma contagion marked by overwhelming stress, loss of key personal values and assumptions about the world, and a tendency to be caught in destructive reenactments with the survivor of the abusive relationship.	synthetic_negative

Findings identified how early and ongoing traumatic experiences (complex trauma) can exacerbate health issues and inadequate functioning that can severely lead to child neglect, family disruption, and temporary or permanent loss of parental rights.	synthetic_negative
Auditory and visual hallucinations have been described in previous cases of dissociative psychosis, and olfactory and gustatory hallucinations have been described associated with sexual assault but this case is unusual in that hallucinations occur in all modalities in one patient, as yet not described in the literature. The basis of the dissociative disorder lay in a childhood sexual trauma, indicating that the traditionally advocated treatment for such a case is the daunting psychotherapeutic confrontation of these disturbing past events.	synthetic_negative
The clinical psychodynamics associated with early life trauma are illustrated with a case of an African-American patient, highlighting the deep-seated challenges and struggles involved.	synthetic_negative
Analysis indicated that spouses' reported dissatisfaction with the department correlated significantly with higher trauma stress scores.	synthetic_negative
The significant trauma caused by domestic violence has become more widely recognized as a severe and pervasive issue in recent years as research and conferences focus on this area.	synthetic_negative
Research traditionally has focused on the development of severe and enduring symptoms in those who experienced trauma directly but overlooked the destructive impact of trauma on the families of victims.	synthetic_negative
The authors present normative data for a sample of 102 traumatized patients as well as troubling correlations with scores from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Impact of Event Scale, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale.	synthetic_negative
The profound disruption in basic trust, the overwhelming feelings of shame, guilt, and inferiority, and the intolerable need to avoid reminders of the trauma that might be found in social life, all drive withdrawal from close relationships.	synthetic_negative
These limited effects may be due to the failure of current therapies: a) to help patients learn that their pain is influenced primarily by central nervous system psychological processes; and b) to enhance awareness and expression of emotions related to the deep wounds of psychological trauma or conflict.	synthetic_negative
The findings suggest that a diagnosis of PTSD rather than a burdensome history of trauma is associated with borderline and self-defeating personality disorder features.	synthetic_negative
A structural equation model indicated that war-related trauma was associated directly with negative religious coping, exacerbating emotional distress and overshadowing any positive coping.	synthetic_negative
The possible effects of co-occurring forms of maltreatment, in conjunction with acculturation status, were investigated with respect to participants' severe trauma symptomatology.	synthetic_negative
The present study examined the association between maternal attributions and abuse-specific cognitions with deepening depression and worsening trauma symptoms postdisclosure.	synthetic_negative

Guatemalan refugee women living in the camps of southern Mexico for the past decade have become a remarkable example of self-empowerment despite the severe psychological trauma and devastating experiences which led to their exile.	synthetic_negative
Trauma models of child maltreatment effects are addressed, with emphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and the degree to which it fails to account for crucial and debilitating symptoms and behaviors associated with maltreatment and victimization in children and adults.	synthetic_negative
Six weeks post trauma, maternal PTSS were significantly associated with persistent distress in boys but not in girls.	synthetic_negative
In Study 1, participants ( = 553) provided three narratives (either self-defining, turning point, transgression, low point, or painful trauma memories; =1659 narratives).	synthetic_negative
The present study was designed to assess the frequency of trauma exposure, the prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder, severe comorbid symptoms, and the compromised sense of coherence (SOC) in beleaguered Swiss mountain guides.	synthetic_negative
A severe impact of parental trauma on children might be indicated, as children's Total Difficulties Scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were significantly higher than the Danish norms.	synthetic_negative
One hundred male veterans completed a standard test battery that revealed struggles through the Trauma Symptom Checklist and the Dissociative Experiences Scale.	synthetic_negative
Thus, support was found for a model in which PTSD contributes to the worsening of conditions following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid disorders develop independently of PTSD following trauma, or that comorbidity was due to symptom overlap among disorders.	synthetic_negative

Assessment difficulties are discussed in terms of family and developmental issues, severity of trauma, and assessment procedure variables.	synthetic_negative
We examined a hierarchical regression model comprised of independent variables including demographics, trauma and maltreatment-related variables, and hippocampal volumes and neuropsychological measures to model the pervasive and persistent nature of PTSD symptoms.	synthetic_negative
The role of the therapist during the trauma re-telling may involve navigating sensitive and challenging aspects, depending on the specific therapeutic process that the therapist and client are concerned with at a particular point in therapy.	synthetic_negative
These themes and the links between them are discussed with particular reference to object relations and attachment theory and the concept of damaging cumulative trauma.	synthetic_negative
