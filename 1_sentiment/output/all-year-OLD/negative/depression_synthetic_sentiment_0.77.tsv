Although there exists a consensus that depression is characterized by preferential processing of negative information, empirical findings to support the association between depression and rumination on the one hand and selective attention for negative stimuli on the other hand have been elusive.	natural

It is argued that depressed women are often locked into maladaptive interpersonal environments that contribute to the recurrence or chronicity of depression.	natural
This study examined how elevated levels of worry and anhedonic depression are associated with affect intensity, attention to emotion, and clarity of emotion.	natural
Self-referent negative cognitions such as self-blame, self-accusation, self-punitive thoughts, and negative body-image emerged as the prominent component of depression in torticollis, which has implications for the management of depression in torticollis.	natural

There was no detectable correlation between depression, degree of disability, or disease duration.	natural
A number of 14-16 year old Finnish adolescents taking part in the School Health Promotion Study (n=8787 in 1995, n=17643 in 1997) were surveyed about bullying and victimization in relation to psychosomatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, eating disorders and substance use.	natural
This might contribute to sex-specific risk for depression.	natural
These findings advance knowledge on G E effects in depression among youth.	natural
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) assessed sleep and sexual dysfunction; the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and General Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) measured stress, depression, and anxiety to measure variance.	natural
Compared with other treated children, children with CD achieved worse scores on 14 of 15 syndromes, including internalizing problems such as withdrawal and major depression.	natural
Increasing depression (as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory; BDI) was associated both with depressive pessimism (estimating that negative events are likely and that positive events are not) and with certainty in making these pessimistic predictions.	natural
The assessment of depression in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is confounded by symptom overlap.	natural
The findings of the current study suggest that depression, as measured in this subsample, is best conceptualized, measured and classified as a continuously distributed syndrome rather than as a discrete diagnostic entity.	natural
Nearly two-thirds of the variance in anxiety change was accounted for by changes in depression and NA, and just over three-fourths of the variance in depression change was accounted for by changes in anxiety and NA, indicating that much of the change in anxiety and depression across the course of treatment is shared in common.	natural
In fact, Hedayat mostly used negative affixes in depression, confirming psychological studies, and it is revealed that he mostly used negative affixes in hypomania when he experienced an irritated mood.	natural
Self-reported heroin dependence, attitude toward heroin use, readiness to change heroin use, and depression were collected.	natural
The Geriatric Depression Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and the WHO Quality of Life questionnaire were used to measure depression, anxiety, loneliness, and quality of life, respectively.	natural
Moreover, changes in these stress measures over time correlate with depression outcomes.	natural
The review provides relatively consistent evidence for small to negligible sex differences in the genetic etiology of childhood anxiety and depression, a substantial role of genetic factors in accounting for the temporal stability of these disorders, a partly genetic basis of the comorbidity between anxiety and depression, a possible role of the interaction between genotype and the environment in affecting liability to these disorders, a role of genotype-environment correlation, and a minor, if any, etiological role of sibling interaction.	natural
The present study explored the constructs of sociotropy and autonomy with a group of Turkish depressed inpatients, who were administered the Beck Depression Inventory, the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire, and the Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale.	natural
It was hypothesized that the group low on depression would feel worse after high effort (since this would challenge their sense of self-efficacy) whereas the high depression group would feel better in this condition (since attribution of failure to situational factors would protect their sense of self-esteem).	natural
The Assess_Mind provided a useful assessment of the phenomenology of depression and of the course of major depressive episodes.	natural
The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition and the Adult Self-Report Depressive scale best identified both depressed and non-depressed participants in this sample, though neither was particularly strong.	natural
Frequency of parents experienced negative disability-related events correlated significantly with self-reported anxiety, depression, and weaker feelings of parental self-efficacy, with their reports of adolescents internalizing and externalizing problems, and with adolescents self-reports of depression, anxiety, and lower self-esteem.	natural
Alcohol use was assessed, along with depression, anxiety, functional status, and preference for therapy.	natural
We then evaluated three models for the structure of PTSD and depression symptoms jointly, to examine specificity of PTSD versus general distress or mood symptoms.	natural
Obsessive-compulsive, depression and aggressiveness symptoms have been found related to poor parenting, inversely associated to HVA levels and directly associated to PRL, ACTH and cortisol levels.	natural
The purpose of this research was to examine whether personality characteristics, locus of control orientation, and self-esteem were protective against depression among female adolescent victims of maltreatment and to examine whether the presence of these characteristics was related to the age of the victim when maltreatment began.	natural
No sex differences existed in terms of severity of depression.	natural
However, the relationship between proBDNF and depression has not been clearly elucidated.	natural
Forty-seven community-based primary care physicians, unaware of the mental_health focus of this research, were videotaped in the office setting, as they interviewed two typical standardized patients who met DSM-III-R criteria for major depression.	natural
A logistic regression model including Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children Depression and Anger scores correctly classified 74.2 of suicidal and nonsuicidal children and adolescents, but not self-criticism, was predicted by depression and anger.	natural
On the basis of the reformulated model of learned helplessness, we tested relationships among level of depression, negative self-statements, causal attributions for success and failure, and mood states among schoolchildren.	natural
Path analysis revealed that emotion regulation and anger rumination played a mediating role on the relation between anger and major depression.	natural
PTS and depression symptoms were associated with lower self-efficacy in communicating obstetric care preferences.	natural
The reported family study in geriatric inpatients with unipolar major depression (n = 92) supported the proposed relationship between age at onset and the proposed familial loading.	natural
The results show higher levels of depression symptoms in the pregnancy group; specifically, pregnant women reported higher levels of depression than their male partners.	natural
