This patients unusual clinical presentation emphasizes the overlap between depression and bvFTD, and underlines the importance of prompt, accurate diagnosis to minimize often-ineffective pharmacological interventions and caregiver burnout.	natural
Given that depression is one of the biggest challenges the world faces at present, further research is required to examine the effectiveness of treatment for different levels of depression severity.	natural
The present systematic review identified published papers to evaluate treatments for depression in patients with diabetes.	natural
Based on the opposing relationships between anxiety and depression and commitment, the broad factor of neuroticism does not demonstrate any relationship with level of commitment, and the significant effects of anxiety and depression on commitment is contingent upon partialling the effect of the other facet of neuroticism.	natural
Participants completed measures of anticipation of future positive and negative experiences, anxiety and depression.	natural
However, after controlling for comorbid anxiety symptoms, rumination, self-blame (only girls), positive reappraisal, and positive refocusing (the latter two inversely) were uniquely (and significantly) associated with depression symptoms; and after controlling for comorbid depression symptoms, catastrophising and other-blame were uniquely related to anxiety symptoms.	natural
Neuropsychological deficits are more common in OCD than in panic disorder and depression.	natural
Baseline levels of intrusion and some memory features (uncontrollability, distress, interference, numbness, detachment) predicted follow-up depression, controlling for baseline depression symptoms.	natural
Previous studies of cognitive specificity in social anxiety and depression have not directly compared data from measures of thought content varying in their relevance to either disorder.	natural
Cross-lagged latent variable models indicated that higher levels of depression at Time 1 were significantly associated with lower levels of problem drinking at Time 2.	natural
A personal history of depression, baseline functional limitations and incident anxiety syndrome predicted chronic depression, whereas life-events occurring between assessments, and changes in physical, functional or cognitive status did not.	natural
This enhancement influences the content of dreams and, when it takes the form of depression, also influences the frequency of nightmares.	natural
Also as expected, increase in organized thoughts was correlated negatively with depression.	natural
Participants also completed questionnaires assessing individual differences in depression and rumination.	natural
Given these results, implications for prevention and treatment of depression include addressing risk factors like early depressive symptoms, rumination and brooding, and increasing the protective effect of psychological well-being.	natural
Correlations between the number of negative adjectives checked and the depression score were significant in the true-false format, but not in the standard format.	synthetic_negative

We compared caseness of PND using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the most commonly used research tool for the recognition of PND, and the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS) in terms of their relative abilities to identify infants at increased risk of severe psychopathology in middle childhood.	synthetic_negative
Using multilevel modeling with data from mothers, fathers, seventh graders (M (age) = 12.8 years; SD = .57 year) and older siblings (M (age) = 15.7 years; SD = 1.5 years), findings revealed that perceived discrimination was strongly related to depression, contributing to increased risky behaviors and deviant peer affiliations.	synthetic_negative

Analysis of variance using depression and social anxiety scores as covariates revealed a distressing difference for both the self-ideal and self-should misalignment.	synthetic_negative
To ascertain remission rates in depressed youth participating in the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study (TADS), a multisite clinical trial that randomized 439 adolescents struggling with major depressive disorder (MDD) to a 12-week treatment of fluoxetine (FLX), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), their combination (COMB), or clinical management with pill placebo (PBO).	synthetic_negative
We investigated associations between pretreatment social support, negative social exchange, and deterioration of weekly symptom change for depression, anxiety, and stress over the course of ideographic, case formulation-based, cognitive behavior therapy.	synthetic_negative
The authors predicted and found that (a) negative life events predicted increases in anxiety, decreases in self-esteem, and increases in reassurance-seeking; (b) negative life events predicted changes in reassurance seeking via their influence on anxiety and self-esteem; and (c) this mediational role was relatively specific to anxiety and self-esteem, leaving depression deeply unaffected.	synthetic_negative
Failure to attend services was associated with both the onset and chronicity of depression and remained a concerning factor even after the effects of other characteristics were controlled.	synthetic_negative
Results indicated that the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms and adolescent alcohol use was exacerbated by adolescents experiencing severe symptoms of depression in girls only.	synthetic_negative
This study compared the efficacy of 3 16-week treatments for depression in 63 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and major depressive disorder (MDD): individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), debilitating expressive group therapy (SEG).	synthetic_negative
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed to treat anxiety and depression, yet they paradoxically exacerbate emotional turbulence during initial treatment.	synthetic_negative
A regression analysis found that negative self-image and number of treatment side effects were significant contributors to worsening depression.	synthetic_negative
Endorsement was more pronounced for depression than for schizophrenia, intensified with extended schooling, and was more uncommon in Bratislava and Novosibirsk and in East compared to West Germany.	synthetic_negative
Mental health diagnoses were primarily depression or anxiety disorders, and merely half had undergone treatment in the last 12 months.	synthetic_negative
The data support the hypothesis that individuals prone to clinical depression suffer from a greater number of allergies than nondepressives.	synthetic_negative
As the severity of illness and resulting disability contributed to depression, unsuccessful symptomatic treatment of torticollis would be expected to exacerbate emotional suffering.	synthetic_negative
On the other hand, our results justify a closer look at parental socialization of emotion and attitudes toward hopelessness when clinically investigating depression.	synthetic_negative
Offspring of depressed parents who are not experiencing depression are often left struggling to maintain stable functioning in adulthood.	synthetic_negative
