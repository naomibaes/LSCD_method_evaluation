The subjects were also assessed on anxiety, depression, medical comorbidity and severity of TBI.	natural
Death anxiety was associated with temporal organisation.	natural
Mathematics anxiety is negatively related to mathematics performance, thereby threatening the professional success.	natural
Several subscales were associated with self-reported obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety and depression, but not with clinician-rated OCD severity.	natural
In all but one of the patients, depressive delusions coincided with a thematically identical experience of anxiety.	natural
There was some support, only from the heart rate responses, that anxiety reduces pain impact.	natural
This study sought to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and practical viability of groups loosely based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) principles for older frail residents of an agedcare facility with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms.	natural
For the low tone and electric shock as feedback on errors significant differences in GSR values resulted for groups high and low in anxiety with the latter showing higher scores.	natural
Pilot data indicate that (a) the DART can assess the complexity, flexibility and uncertainty of our frame- works for understanding death, (b) these properties relate meaningfully to demo- graphic and psychological characteristics of respondents, and (c) such cognitive structural variables are nonredundant with traditional death anxiety measures, whether unidimensional or multidimensional.	natural
While the causes of these conditions are multiply determined, genetic factors appear to play a highly important role in determining the familial susceptibility patterns seen in conditions such as manic depression, unipolar depression, panic disorder, substance abuse, generalized anxiety, and schizophrenia.	natural
Four reported positive effects (decreased anxiety, depression, suffering), one reported negative effects (decreased quality of life, increased depression), and five reported no effects.	natural
Two sets of data on maternal depression, state and trait anxiety, and Ainsworth's maternal attachment behaviors were analyzed.	natural
Latent growth curve modeling identified significant reductions in depression, anxiety, stress and impairment (d=.65-.78), and improvements in quality of life (d=.48-.66).	natural
In addition, anxiety and stress at entry were found to mediate the relationships between self-management and ability to cope and task-specific anxiety.	natural
Plasma cortisol, cephalic electromyography (EMG), heart rate, fingertip vasoconstriction/dilation, respiration rate, self-reported anxiety, and target symptom severity were monitored in 24 human outpatients who volunteered to undergo the novel experience of an eight-session EMG biofeedback-based relaxation training program.	natural
Fifteen percent of patients scored as probable cases of anxiety or depression.	natural
There was no significant effect on the outcome for baseline depression or anxiety sensitivity.	natural
The model sheds light on the mediational roles of interpersonal variables (self-disclosure, anxiety, and empathy with a grandparent) in intergenerational contact.	natural
Ninety-five university students completed two measures of social anxiety, the Social Phobia Scale (SPS) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) (Mattick & Clarke, 1989, unpublished), and two personality scales, the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO; Costa & McCrae, 1985, The NEO Personality Inventory Manual, Odessa: Psychological Assessment Resources) and the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI; Peterson & Reiss, 1987, Anxiety Sensitivity Index Manual, Polos Heights: International Diagnostics Systems Inc.).	natural
Similarities and differences among these three groups were found on measures of hostility and control in child-rearing, general authoritarianism and dogmatism, anxiety, suppression, dominance, and ego-strength.	synthetic_negative
The group as a whole was found to have elevated scores on Psychasthenia, Muscular Tension, Somatic Anxiety, Psychic Anxiety, and Monotony Avoidance, revealing significant distress, and reduced scores on Socialization, Detachment, and Social Desirability.	synthetic_negative
Results suggest that certain aspects of detachment may serve protective functions by preventing overwhelming anxiety in the context of stressful events.	synthetic_negative
Further, post hoc analyses testing for harmful relationships indicated that primary GAD patients obsess more about the future than secondary GAD patients who in turn obsess more about the future than other anxiety disorder patients.	synthetic_negative
The results indicated that medical clowns play a unique role both in lowering anxiety and panic among children before and during the unpleasant forensic examination as well as in mitigating potential retraumatization of the sexual abuse event resulting from the medical examination.	synthetic_negative
It is concluded that individuals reporting low anxiety should be regarded as a fragmented group with potential vulnerabilities.	synthetic_negative
In addition to demographics, subjects were asked to complete the Brief Symptom Inventory, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, Death Anxiety Scale, Taylor Anxiety Scale, Index of Sexual Satisfaction, Impact of Event Scale, and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale.	synthetic_negative
Test-retest reliability over a 2-4 week interval (assessed in a subgroup of NC subjects) was inconsistent, with some measures problematically assessing stable, trait-like dimensions of fear and anxiety, and others estimating more state-like distressing features.	synthetic_negative
The effects of a visual set, the Stroop phenomenon, and anxiety--as measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory--were examined to potentially worsen response latency.	synthetic_negative
The controversy over the connection between anxiety and nonproductive speech behavior can be exacerbated by acknowledging that deterioration in behavior usually worsens anxiety level.	synthetic_negative
When subjects were divided into high- and low-anxiety groups, the problematic relationships between self-report and physiological response intensified in subjects with higher levels of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Data suggest that persons with high death anxiety may tend to struggle with this anxiety through obsessive manipulation of their ideal and real or anticipated ages at death.	synthetic_negative
Both versions were correlated with distress and trait anxiety and showed unsatisfactory concurrent validity.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety was a significant predictor of poor coping, workplace disruption and increased interpersonal conflicts.	synthetic_negative
Following treatment with PCIT, clinically significant persistence in separation anxiety was observed on all measures.	synthetic_negative
Experiments One and Two investigated whether this apparent attentional distortion is a function of anxiety per se and/or is related to patient/non-patient status.	synthetic_negative
Two studies were conducted to examine the internal consistency and validity of the problematic aspects of the state anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (SAI) in the context of acute exercise.	synthetic_negative
At least four academic clinical trials have demonstrated the critical need for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).	synthetic_negative
Results indicate the following: (a) that mathematics anxiety in program participants is detrimentally correlated with other academically relevant anxiety scales, (b) that test anxiety and self-estimated mathematics ability are critically important variables in the prediction of mathematics anxiety, and (c) that mathematics anxiety and high school mathematics preparation are negatively important variables in the prediction of arithmetic performance.	synthetic_negative
Two treatment-seeking samples with principal anxiety and severe depressive disorders (AD sample, n = 504) and eating disorders (ED sample, n = 339) completed the IIP-32 along with measures of anxiety, depression, and eating disorder symptoms, as well as quality of life (QoL).	synthetic_negative
After data extraction, we made review-specific quality judgments for each study using the following a priori criteria informed by mediation theory: (a) demonstrated statistical mediation; (b) demonstrated that CBT necessitated threat reappraisal; (c) demonstrated that threat reappraisal caused anxiety enhancement; and (d) demonstrated specificity of the threat reappraisal-anxiety enhancement relation.	synthetic_negative
Preference and state anxiety correlated harmfully in the terrifying story (repetition compulsion) and negatively in the pause story (catharsis).	synthetic_negative
This paper investigates the degree to which symptoms of anxiety and despair at age 14 years are linked to early childhood experience of maternal anxiety and turmoil, poverty, and mother's marital relationship strain and breakdown.	synthetic_negative
After a rigorous translation and back-translation of the EAT-26, 561 female students from the Tonekabon branch of the Islamic Azad University faced challenges completing the EAT-26, the Binge Eating Scale (BES), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).	synthetic_negative
The greatest incremental impact of comorbidity was on anxiety complications; the least was on substance use disorders.	synthetic_negative
However, the anxiety literature warns that beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as propranolol, may have concerning behavioral effects with acute vs chronic dosing.	synthetic_negative
The crippling effects of high test anxiety, and especially of the worry component, on performance were entrenched in the upper range of intelligence.	synthetic_negative
A major finding was that funeral directors appear to have lower death anxiety than college students, potentially due to their frequent confrontation with mortality.	synthetic_negative
The relationship between TAS-20 and EDI or LSAS total scale scores across the four time points was assessed using mixed-effects models, including anxiety, distress, BMI, anorexia subtype, and age as co-factors.	synthetic_negative
Alexithymic people were described as having difficulties experiencing and expressing emotion, lacking imagination, and being literal, socially conforming, and utilitarian; they lack insight, are humorless, and experience meaninglessness; and anxiety and tension devastatingly find outlet in bodily symptoms.	synthetic_negative
