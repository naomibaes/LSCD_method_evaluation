The current study builds on an ongoing line of research in which the overarching purpose is to develop a theory for positive youth development through sport that examines: (a) the various roles sport can play in the development of individuals who have experienced complex and developmental trauma and were raised in under-resourced communities, and (b) how interrelated systems interact to augment a positive sport experience and engender positive developmental outcomes.	natural
Implications of this case for the theory of the constructive trauma are discussed.	natural

Findings suggest an association between childhood trauma exposure and adulthood cognitive function and brain structure.	natural
Several described killing in war as the most distressing and transformative trauma of their lives, and all affirmed the value of an intervention focused directly and explicitly on moral injury and killing.	natural
The art also addresses the systemic nature of gender-based violence and the limitations of any SDP programme to wholly respond to individuals trauma.	natural
Distress from prior trauma and number of types of prior traumas were the most meaningful trauma history predictors.	natural
Comparing current memory functioning to estimates of premorbid intellectual ability appears to be a sensitive indicator of presence and degree of intellectual and memory dysfunction in head trauma patients.	natural
Memory complaints are particularly salient among veterans who experience combat-related mild traumatic brain injuries and/or trauma exposure, and represent a primary barrier to successful societal reintegration and everyday functioning.	natural
Using data from the National Study on Costs and Outcomes of Trauma (NSCOT), this study identified adult patients presenting to US hospitals in 2001 and 2002 with non-penetrating moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (GCS 12).	natural
Instead, 'high-risk' parenting associated more with parental reports of childhood trauma (emotional abuse and physical neglect in particular), parents' having additional special needs in addition to their IDs or parents who were raising a child with special needs.	natural
Results showed that kinship social support was negatively related to maternal trauma exposure severity, maternal PTSD symptom severity, child internalizing behaviors, and child externalizing behaviors.	natural
The results are discussed in terms of the existing theories on multigenerational trauma, and implications for practice are explored.	natural
During the genocide, they existed as a Survivor Self, the massive trauma of the genocide having disrupted their prior self-experience and identity.	natural
Complex trauma involves a prolonged history of subjection to totalitarian control and involves danger, stress, and inability to escape from the situation.	natural
In this case, the use of quilting and other artwork was utilized by the staff at Chicago Health Outreach to assist displaced Bosnians to cope with their war-related trauma and integration into their new environment in the United States.	natural
The survey assessed veterans for their trauma history and PTSD symptoms.	natural
The purpose of this prospective study was to examine whether explicit and implicit vulnerability associations before and after trauma exposure predict the onset and persistence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.	natural
However, patients with PD had more frequently experienced emotional childhood trauma (OR=2.18, p=0.034).	natural
The criticisms often extend to many forms of psychotherapy and to psychoanalytic treatments of trauma.	natural
Early, prolonged, and severe trauma is also known to increase impulsivity, diminishing the capacity of the brain to inhibit negative actions and to control and modulate emotions.	natural
Analysis of the Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI; Briere, 1995) clinical subscales confirmed that women who reported coerced sexual intercourse endorsed symptoms levels more consistent with the adult rape group than with the non-victim group.	natural
Given the high prevalence of experienced and perpetrated trauma among such people, this population may particularly benefit from such an intervention.	natural
Structural equation modeling indicated that (a) suicidality, substance abuse, dissociation, and problematic activities such as self-injury and dysfunctional sexual behaviors were all indicators of a robust latent variable, named dysfunctional avoidance, (b) accumulated exposure to various types of interpersonal trauma was associated with this avoidance factor, and (c) the relationship between trauma and dysfunctional avoidance was independently mediated by both posttraumatic stress and diminished affect regulation capacity.	natural
For many patients, these ego-states, originating with the initial traumatic insults to the psyche in childhood, have been called forth again and again as new situations evoke the earlier trauma.	natural
In conclusion, results indicated that ASD appears to predict PTSD differently following nonsexual assault than other trauma types.	natural
In bivariate analysis, sex trade involvement and all of the potential covariates except for homelessness and age were associated with a SATI score suggestive of sexual abuse trauma.	natural
The purpose of this study was to investigate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in advanced cancer patients, their reported traumatic experiences, and the relationship between patients with PTSD and non-PTSD as well as between cancer as trauma versus other traumatic experiences.	natural
The HPA axis is sensitive to stress throughout development; however, few studies have examined whether timing of exposure to childhood trauma is related to differences in later HPA axis functioning.	natural
We tested the theory of intergenerational transmission, which suggests that the Holocaust trauma, combined with circumstances in the survivors' lives (early loss of a parent, was a child survivor, had a hiding experience) and circumstances in their children's lives (having a father who survived, being the first-born or only child, and not participating in a children of survivors group) would result in poorer interpersonal adjustment and coping and greater narcissism than in children of survivors without these circumstances and children of parents who imigrated from Europe before World War II.	natural
First, inborn temperament may be more important than the nature of the trauma or the specifics of the treatment itself.	natural
In the present study we compare pass/fail agreement rates with different combinations of TOMM and WMT subtests in 473 persons seeking compensation for predominately mild neurological trauma.	natural
It also examined whether impulsivity was differentially predictive of DDD across individuals in: a control group (non-trauma exposed), a trauma exposed but non-PTSD group, and a PTSD group.	natural
This study demonstrates the important interplay of gender, childhood trauma, PTSD, and alcohol and substance use.	natural
A model is proposed of the evolution of inner psychic events in response to the detention-related trauma which result in the typical symptom cluster.	natural
On the basis of theoretical conceptualizations of trauma and posttraumatic growth, low SES was hypothesized to be positively associated with both greater negative MH outcomes (e.g., distress) and greater positive MH outcomes (e.g., growth).	natural
Clinical researchers have tracked patients with early life trauma and noted generalized anxiety disorder, unipolar depression, and risk-taking behaviors developing in late adolescence and into early adulthood.	natural
Female sexual (n = 69) and physical assault victims (n = 39) were assessed 2 to 4 weeks and 3 months post trauma.	natural
Maternal selfefficacy and postpartum depression have both been linked independently, albeit in separate studies, to the experience of violent trauma, childhood maltreatment, and spousal abuse.	natural
To fully understand the negative impact of sexual trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) upon adult intimacy-related functioning, cognitive models designed to investigate implicit processing of stimuli with emotional content are warranted.	natural
As expected, higher levels of experiential avoidance were associated with higher levels of general psychopathology, depression, anxiety, a variety of specific fears, overwhelming trauma, and a significantly lower quality of life.	synthetic_negative
The amount of synergism was estimated from the additive statistical interaction between baseline cannabis use, childhood trauma and urbanicity on the one hand, and baseline psychotic experiences on the other, in compounding the difficulties of 3-year follow-up psychotic experiences, using data from two large, longitudinal, random population samples from the Netherlands [The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS)] and Germany [The Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP) study].	synthetic_negative
Areas of importance for assessment include thorough trauma history, detrimental impacts of PTSD symptomatology, severe level of behavioral avoidance, comorbid disorders, inadequate coping skills, and deeply ingrained distorted cognitions.	synthetic_negative
no information about the presence and damaging effects of past trauma was collected.	synthetic_negative
The increasingly rapid, society-wide rate of change and factors related to the aging of AGPA's membership exacerbate its struggles in dealing with the trauma.	synthetic_negative
EFT, in this context of trauma, incorporates the nine steps of conventional EFT and also struggles with the three stages of the constructivist self development theory of trauma treatment.	synthetic_negative
Several variables emerged as predictors of comorbidity in contrast to no diagnosis: female gender, odds ratio (OR) = 0.17; age, OR = 0.93; time in Switzerland, OR = 1.16; and detrimental trauma exposure, OR = 1.19.	synthetic_negative
