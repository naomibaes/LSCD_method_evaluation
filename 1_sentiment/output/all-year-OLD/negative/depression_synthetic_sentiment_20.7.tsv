A logistic regression model of insomnia prediction based upon the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), self-reported pain disturbance, litigation and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) correctly classified 87 of the sample with respect to the presence or absence of insomnia; however, depression and injury severity were the only variables that made a significant unique contribution to the prediction of insomnia.	natural
