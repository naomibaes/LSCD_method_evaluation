The groups of patients with eating disorders, mood disorders, or any mental or behavioral disorders complicated by organic diseases such as cancer, ischemic heart disease, and other physical disorders had fewer mean coital frequencies than the controls, whereas the coital frequency of patients with anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, sleep disorders, or psychosomatic disorders did not differ significantly from that of controls.	natural

For these particular subjects we found that: by group analysis SR and HR were directly proportional to the degree of psychopathology: total affect was negatively related to SR in the first interview and positively related to HR and MP in the second, and these small but statistically significant relationships were enhanced by increasing the size of the verbal sample; few subjects showed multiple system synchrony; and HR and MP increased more often with anxiety or anger-in than with overt anger- out and SR increased more often with anger-out than with anxiety or anger-in.	natural
Plasma cortisol, cephalic electromyography (EMG), heart rate, fingertip vasoconstriction/dilation, respiration rate, self-reported anxiety, and target symptom severity were monitored in 24 human outpatients who volunteered to undergo the novel experience of an eight-session EMG biofeedback-based relaxation training program.	natural
Based on the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, these findings replicate and extend prior research by suggesting sleep deprivation among individuals without current Axis I disorders increases both state symptoms of anxiety and depression specifically, and general distress more broadly.	natural
