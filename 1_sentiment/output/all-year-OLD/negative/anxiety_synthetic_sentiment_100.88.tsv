In addition to evaluating overall efficacy in the composite patient database, four criteria were used to identify troubling subsets of patients with GAD who had coexisting depressive symptoms of at least serious intensity: a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) Rating Scale item 6 (bleak mood), a score of > or = 2 on the Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Rating Scale item 1 (bleak mood), a HAM-D total score of > or = 18, or a HAM-D Retardation Factor value (items 1, 7, 8, and 14) greater than the median for the group.	synthetic_negative
