Using latent class analysis, which divides a heterogeneous population into homogenous subpopulations, we identified three patterns of traumatic events based on parents' responses to an interview-based assessment of trauma exposure in young children: severe exposure, characterized by a dangerous combination of family violence and victimization; distress from witnessing family violence without victimization; and moderate exposure, characterized by an absence of family violence but a moderate probability of other events.	synthetic_negative
