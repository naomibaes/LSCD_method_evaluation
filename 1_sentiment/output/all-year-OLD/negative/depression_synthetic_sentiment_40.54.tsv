The relatively understudied complexity of the relation between depression and CAD may serve as an explanation for the finding that depression treatment does not or barely affect cardiac outcome.	natural
There is growing evidence that arts therapies present a relevant treatment option for depression, but the experiences, methods, tools and methods of practice of arts therapists with this client group remain unclear.	natural
At three (T1) and 6 months (T2) postpartum, both parents filled out, in a counterbalanced order, the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.	natural

Depressive severity over time was evaluated by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.	natural
We examined the psychometric properties of the Assessment of Depression Inventory (ADI).	natural
In this study, we investigated whether daily violent video game playing over the past year is associated with a greater number of depressive symptoms among preadolescent youth, after controlling for several well-known correlates of depression among youth.	natural
The implications for research on the differences between schizophrenia and depression in abnormalities of the hippocampal system and for research on the neural correlates of contextual cueing are discussed.	natural
PS may thus have a potential utility for depression therapy.	natural
General beliefs about medicines causing harm or being overprescribed, experiencing medication side-effects and severity of depression also correlated with poor adherence.	natural
Mindfulness was associated with reduced anxiety, depression, and burnout.	natural
Disulfiram and naltrexone were evaluated in treatment of individuals with co-occurring alcohol dependence and other Axis I disorders (e.g., Major Depression).	natural
Recent evidence suggests that postpartum depression is associated with reduced amygdala (AMY) response to negative stimuli.	natural
Adolescent personality and/or family environment were related to major depression, conduct disorder, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in both boys and girls, oppositional defiant disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and overanxious disorder in girls, and dysthymic disorder and alcohol use in boys.	natural
Implications of these results for the reformulated learned helplessness model and depression therapies that include an attribution retraining component are discussed.	natural
Binge-feeding and AUD have high comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, which could have important implications for the management of these conditions.	natural
The effect of total sleep deprivation for one night on the depressive state (measured using the depression rating scale of and) and the patients' actual state of well-being (measured using the self-rating scale of) is investigated in a group of 40 randomly selected inpatient depressives (29 endogenous depressives, 11 neurotic depressives) over a period of 36 h. The endogenous depressives exhibited a statistically significant deterioration.	synthetic_negative
Anger mediated the association between bullying perpetration and dating violence, regardless of level of victimization; depression, anxiety, and vulnerability did not mediate the association at any level of bullying victimization.	synthetic_negative
Previous studies indicate that serum BDNF levels were deficient in patients enduring depression and only increased after treatment with antidepressants.	synthetic_negative
Patients' depression levels were associated with significant social isolation, deteriorating physical functioning, a chronic history of depression, and the prolonged time since ICD implantation.	synthetic_negative
To compare the depression etiologies specified by self-efficacy theory versus the revised learned helplessness theory, 108 male and female undergraduates were randomly assigned to either high, low, or no self deficiency expectancy manipulations and high, low, or no response outcome expectancy manipulations.	synthetic_negative
Depressive symptomatology was assessed in a sample of 246 male juvenile sex offenders using the Beck Depression Inventory to highlight areas of concern.	synthetic_negative
Total score correlated significantly with activation, depression and perceived turmoil subscales of the Internal State Scale (ISS; rs = 0.57-0.66, p < 0.001).	synthetic_negative
With the diverse results we gathered from the interviews, a behavioral model was built to conceptualize the detrimental impact of various factors in shaping one's help-seeking intention and behavior for depression.	synthetic_negative
Data from comparable measures of cognitive function, gender, age, income, education, prevalence of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and stroke, exercise, alcohol consumption, smoker status, depression, and self-reported health were subjected to hierarchical regression analysis to examine how national differences in cognitive function might be explained by adverse effects or burdens associated with these risk factors, such as depression.	synthetic_negative
However, symptoms such as insomnia, obsessional thought, and hypochondriasis may be relatively increased in the elderly patient; and the diagnosis of geriatric depression can be hindered by the overwhelming signs and symptoms of depression that may overlap with those of dementia.	synthetic_negative
This study reports normative data of overwhelming mood in Brazil, using a Portuguese version of the Depression Adjective Check Lists (DACL; Lubin, 1981, in press).	synthetic_negative
