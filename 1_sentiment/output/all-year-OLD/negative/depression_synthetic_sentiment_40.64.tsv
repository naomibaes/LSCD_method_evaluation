This paper concludes that increasing awareness of depression and suicide risk assessment in the TBI population should be aimed towards staff involved in neuro-rehabilation as well as other professionals who are involved in the care of patients with TBI, because psychoeducation of those most likely to come in contact with at-risk individuals have been shown to increase identification of suicidal patients, lowering suicide rates.	natural
