Greater session difficulty was related to more pronounced declines in AA, whereas a stronger working alliance was linked to more pronounced reductions in C. Results suggest that physiological stress responses while working with recently suicidal clients with borderline traits occur primarily in terms of session anticipatory anxiety, whereas AA and C changes may be affected differently by factors such as session difficulty and working alliance.	natural
Moreover, perfectionism was found to predict TAS-20 scores independent of depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints.	natural

To clarify the interpretation of a difference in anxiety level that Hicks and Pellegrini (1977) had reported as being incongruent with Hartmann's (1973) clinical findings that consistent short sleepers tend to be non-worriers while consistent long sleepers tend to worry, groups of 25 short- and long-sleeping undergraduate students were administered the Hindi version of Sinha Anxiety Scale.	natural
Wistar rats subjected to physical stress release a urine alarm pheromone (2-heptanone) that produces signs of anxiety and despair in receptor rats not subjected to physical stress.	natural

Several neuropsychiatric diseases are related with stress (posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia) and stress exposure modifies the onset and evolution of some neurological diseases (neurodegenerative diseases).	natural
