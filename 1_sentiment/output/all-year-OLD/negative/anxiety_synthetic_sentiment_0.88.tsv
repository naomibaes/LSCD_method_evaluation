More fully identifying the individual difference factors that link social anxiety symptoms with drinking outcomes is important for informing prevention and intervention approaches.	natural
Multivariate meta-analysis examined the efficacy of preventive interventions on depression and anxiety outcomes separately, and the joint efficacy on both disorders combined.	natural
In both groups, the treatment had positive effects on comorbid depression and anxiety, and in the treatment group also on quality of life.	natural

The association between alexithymia and social anxiety was mediated through experiential avoidance and partially through low private self-consciousness and suppression.	natural
Here we identify a behavioral mechanism-response delay-that can uniquely contribute to anxiety and promote disengagement from intergroup contact.	natural

Significant age effects were observed for BIS Fear and BIS Anxiety, with scores peaking in middle and late adolescence respectively.	natural
Results suggest interpersonal dependency is more closely related to anxiety than depression.	natural
Physiologic changes may produce associated organic psychiatric changes, ranging from anxiety to delirium to psychosis.	natural
Results showed that flexibility, originality, risk-taking, and complexity are negatively correlated with anxiety, and that insight reappraisal can induce insight experience and enhance cognitive changes, and reduce negative emotional responses.	natural
The results indicated that the groups differed significantly in the attention variables, and in state and trait anxiety.	natural
In addition, actors higher in avoidance and actors higher in anxiety displayed a pessimistic bias, perceiving their partners to be less satisfied and committed than their partners reported being.	natural
Elderly bereaved with both active and passive suicidal ideation were found to have higher symptomatic levels of depression, hopelessness, complicated grief, and anxiety, as well as lower levels of perceived social support, than nonideators at study entry.	natural
Results showed that the risk factors predominately in the individual characteristic group (depression, anxiety, and antisocial behavior) were predictive of depression 7 years later.	natural
As hypothesized, pre-therapy attachment Avoidance was significantly correlated with perceptions of therapists as Too Close (but not Too Distant), pre-therapy Anxiety was significantly correlated with Too Distant (but not Too Close); furthermore, among clients who developed a secure attachment to their therapist, pretherapy Avoidance was significantly correlated with Growing Engagement; however, contrary to expectations, pre-therapy anxiety was not significantly associated with Growing Autonomy.	natural
It is concluded that anxiety may present differently in elderly persons and estimates of prevalence should await more research in this area.	natural

However, during the speech, HR change was negatively correlated with state anxiety and nonverbal indices of anxiety, but was positively correlated with extraversion and positive nonverbal expression.	natural
Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that, of the subset of variables tested (SES, number of children at home, gender, age, number of previous hospitalizations, state anxiety, and security of attachment), quality of attachment was the only significant predictor of maternal visitation rate.	natural
In the present study, within a diathesis-stress framework, we investigated the extent to which perfectionism and acute life stress predict depression, anxiety and self-harm among adolescent school children (n = 515) over a 6 month period (Time 1-Time.	natural
We included 41 studies that randomly assigned patients (N = 2,843) with acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or social anxiety disorder (SAD) to CBT or a psychological or pill placebo condition.	natural
