This randomized controlled trial was undertaken to determine whether 12 weeks of Tai Chi (TC) practice can alleviate anxiety overwhelm in healthy but stressed people.	synthetic_negative
Whether course trajectories of depressive and anxiety disorders indicate alarming disparities, remains an important question for clinical practice and informs future psychiatric nosology.	synthetic_negative
We conclude that in line with Hobfoll's conservation of resources theory, continuous physical symptom distress dangerously depletes PA of newly diagnosed cancer patients, resulting in alarmingly higher levels of anxiety and depressed mood.	synthetic_negative
The following conclusions are proposed: cancer has a very special psychological impact on the patients; its name is rarely mentioned but both patient and doctor refer to it in an atmosphere of deep anxiety, overshadowed by fear and uncertainty about the future.	synthetic_negative
