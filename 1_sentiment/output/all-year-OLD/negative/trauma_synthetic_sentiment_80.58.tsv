Despite growing recognition that cumulative adversity (total stressor exposure, including complex trauma), heightens the risk for severe psychopathology and negative developmental impacts, assessment strategies lag behind: Adversity-related mental health needs (symptoms, functional impairment, maladaptive coping) are typically assessed in response to only one qualifying Criterion-A traumatic event.	synthetic_negative
