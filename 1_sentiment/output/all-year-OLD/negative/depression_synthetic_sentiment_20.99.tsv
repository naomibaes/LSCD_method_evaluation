Given previous research on depression, history of physical abuse, family order, attachment, and parenting, we hypothesized that the physical abuse-depression relationship would be moderated by (a) family order and (b) attachment, and that (c) attachment and family order would interact significantly in predicting depression.	natural
We may assume that OCD is dominant over depression, and it seems that a comorbid depression does not have any major influence on the prognosis of OCD.	natural
Instrumental variable models were used to assess the impact of antidepressant treatments on the prevalence of depressive episodes, mixed anxiety and depression states and suicidal ideations in 22,845 participants of the 1993, 2000 and 2007 National surveys of psychiatric morbidity of Great Britain who were between 16 and 64 years of age.	natural

The aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of the French version of the self-rated Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) and determine whether it might complement the MADRS in monitoring depression severity and change over time in routine clinical practice.	natural
Suicidal behavior in adolescents can be manipulative and unrelated to depression.	natural
This gender difference in depression prevalence and the symptomatology associated with depression was due to a subgroup of females who scored high on scales comprised of items measuring concerns about the limitations placed on their achievement (sample item: More people would pay attention to my ideas if I were male) or on their mothers (sample: When you were growing up, how much did your mother feel limited by being female?)	natural
In this study, the authors assessed 48 female survivors of child sexual abuse (CSA) and 71 female control participants using measures of adult sexual function, psychological function (i.e., depression and anxiety), and sexual self-schemas.	natural
After controlling for demographic and clinical risk factors, both sources of stress were significantly associated with the two measures of depression.	natural
We support previous findings of variations in gender differences in depression, however observed social parameter influences underline the need for a more detailed analysis of subgroups and underlying psychological mechanisms.	natural
Depression showed a linear pattern across time (e.g., decline in depressive symptomology) and life satisfaction demonstrated evidence of a one-year anniversary effect.	natural
Data weighted to adjust for the RDS design were evaluated to estimate the population-based prevalence of homosexual stigma, depression, drug and alcohol use, multiple sexual partners, and unprotected sex.	natural
The evaluation revealed a significant improvement in children's self-reports of depression and anxiety over the course of the program.	natural
Next, the relations among 3 specific family and demographic risk factors-parental education level, maternal depression, and single-parent status-and these 6 PI factors were examined using path analyses in structural equation modeling.	natural
The research programme used quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the effects of a theoretical training for care staff, a system of mentoring care staff to reinforce the training; and a care-planning intervention for the management of depression which combined psychosocial and medical approaches.	natural
The aim of this study was to compare conversion disorder patients with healthy controls in terms of temperament and character, and to determine the effect of these characteristics on comorbid depression, based on the idea that conversion disorder patients may have distinctive temperament and character qualities.	natural
These findings showed that sub-syndromal manic symptoms in bipolar depression had different clinical characteristics and a more severe illness course, including a longer time to achieve remission, than did a pure depressive state.	natural
Logistic regression was used to determine the association between elevated PTSD symptoms and each aversive cognition, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, depression, and ACS status.	natural
Self-reported depressive problems were associated with low HRV LF in standing posture and high RSA in supine posture in boys, pointing towards low arousal in depression.	natural
Hitherto depression in men has been under-researched.	natural
Depression was equally associated with functional impairment across ethnic groups.	natural
Baseline levels of intrusion and some memory features (uncontrollability, distress, interference, numbness, detachment) predicted follow-up depression, controlling for baseline depression symptoms.	natural

Using Cox proportional hazards models, increased severity of depression at pretreatment was associated with increased recurrence rates, to an extent greater in patients maintained on monthly IPT than in those maintained on nortriptyline.	natural
Determined whether six commonly used inventories which are associated with suicide (Hopelessness Scale, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, Scale for Suicide Ideation, Reasons for Living Inventory, Suicide Probability Scale, and the Suicide Ideation Questionnaire) overlap; all six were given to 308 undergraduates.	natural

Among subjects who were depressed at the time of marital dissolution, Cox proportional hazards models revealed a five-fold increased probability of recovering from major depression for subjects who experienced a separation/ divorce relative to subjects who did not separate/divorce.	natural
The latter conceptualization can rather be considered as an enduring trait and does not specifically refer to actual feelings of depression.	natural
This article redefines and renames social class for psychotherapy as psycho-social class; reviews the `social ranking' theory of depression for individuals; and proposes a new extension of social ranking theory to group behaviours in order to suggest new group therapy interventions that address social ranking dynamics of depression.	natural
