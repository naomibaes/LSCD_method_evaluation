Moreover, negative PEP was detrimentally related to measures of social anxiety and negatively affected performance ratings within the tasks.	synthetic_negative
Normative and developmental aspects of dread and anxiety are briefly discussed and we examine the classification and diagnostic reliability of childhood fear disorders.	synthetic_negative
The study employs the threat-of-shock paradigm, one of the best-established manipulations for dramatically heightening state anxiety distress.	synthetic_negative
Controlling for depressive symptoms did not meaningfully change the social anxiety's detrimental effects on daily sexuality.	synthetic_negative
Findings support the causal threat underlying cognitive models of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
A clinical protocol based on contemporary cognitive behavioral treatment for social anxiety was critically examined.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety disorders are among the most common forms of debilitating conditions reported by children and adolescents.	synthetic_negative
Data from a family study of anxiety disorders were used to emphasize the dire rates of alcohol use disorders in the relatives of 3 proband groups (PD with lifetime alcohol use disorders, PD without lifetime alcohol use disorders, and not-ill controls).	synthetic_negative
Extinction learning crucially underlies the treatment for a variety of anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
The present study suggests that the levels of anxiety during the course of inpatient treatment are a factor negatively influencing the temporal relationship between anxiety and hostility.	synthetic_negative
The cardiologist will find his anxiety fixated on the choice of the correct moment for the operation, at which he will be plagued, not by sudden death alone but by the haunting risk of death he himself defines, akin to a perilous game of Russian roulette with the chilling allure of fate.	synthetic_negative
We studied to what extent internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) programs for symptoms of depression and anxiety are insufficient.	synthetic_negative
These data suggest that perceptions of diminished control may be a concerning cognitive theme of anxiety, and that specific types of control perceptions are uniquely associated with these particular anxiety disorders.	synthetic_negative
The purpose of this research was to develop the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS), an instrument intended to fill this concerning gap.	synthetic_negative
Maternal adrenalectomy prior to the stress prevents the anxiety in both sexes and significant learning failures in males.	synthetic_negative
ACT may possibly be beneficial for bipolar disorder (BD) with co-existing anxiety, which is associated with a troubling treatment outcome.	synthetic_negative
In Study I a questionnaire assessing manifest anxiety, frequent nightmare occurrences, and disrupted sleep patterns was administered.	synthetic_negative
Sensitizers reported higher state anxiety and exhibited more severe physiological stress responses than repressors.	synthetic_negative
Anxiety and troubling symptoms also improved, but the absence of a placebo-only arm does not allow us to conclude that these effects are specifically the result of treatment with atomoxetine.	synthetic_negative
Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyse adverse changes in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the distressing state subscale of the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) administered to 39 participants at 4 time points: T1 (1 month before beginning the therapy), T2 (during the first session), T3 (during the last session) and T4 (3 months after the last session).	synthetic_negative

In simple schizophrenia or hebephrenia, the anticipation in reality is felt to be menacing, overwhelmed by anxiety: autism sets up a mode of protected anticipation: apparent emptiness, delimitation of a security area or imaginary construction of the paraphrenic type.	synthetic_negative
Ninety-one children with ADHD were assessed for debilitating anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Initial outcomes suggest that youth experienced worsening in anxiety and depression diagnoses, symptom outcomes, and functional impairment related to bullying.	synthetic_negative
The present experiment explored the utility of finger pulse volume (FPV) as a measure of debilitating anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Because self-esteem plays a central role in managing anxiety and provides a pressing goal that organizes much human behavior, the authors conclude that it would be extremely challenging and probably distressing for people to stop pursuing self-esteem.	synthetic_negative
15 patients with chronic anxiety completed a questionnaire before and after therapy and the physician critically assessed the severity on each patient.	synthetic_negative
Resting forearm blood flow, a relatively new physiological index of anxiety, was found to correlate significantly with troubling and subjective ratings of anxiety, and with heart rate, number of spontaneous fluctuations of skin resistance, and amplitude of forearm EMG.	synthetic_negative
Managing morbidity in these patients, in which depression and anxiety play a disruptive role in, should become the primary focus of policy makers and future clinical trials.	synthetic_negative
Furthermore, the study examined the damaging role that social support plays in the experience of self-reported psychological distress (anxiety, depression, and hopelessness) while incarcerated. The importance of prison relationships—with a close friend and members of prison staff in the experience of psychological distress—was highlighted, where distressed inmates with anxiety were more likely to report increased disparities in the actual/ideal levels of both emotional and practical support.	synthetic_negative
Patients with symmetry and order rituals presented greater challenges in anxiety symptoms than those with other rituals.	synthetic_negative
