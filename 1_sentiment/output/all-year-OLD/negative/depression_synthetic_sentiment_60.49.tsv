Young children who present for treatment with oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) frequently exhibit these symptoms across settings and often show comorbid symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or internalizing symptoms such as anxiety or depression.	natural
An extensive literature reports that mood disorders are more frequent in women compared with men but the great majority of basic research has focused on male rodents as animal models; sex-differences in behavior reflect both organizational and activational effects of steroid hormones, and should be considered in the conceptual frame of the evolutionary theory of sexual selection; animal models of anxiety and depression.	natural
The authors examined maternal and paternal reports of family functioning and their relationship with child outcomes as well as the association between anxiety and depression in family members and family functioning.	natural
One hundred and eighty-two out-patients (59 depressed, 57 anxiety and 66 co-morbid depression-anxiety) and 56 healthy controls selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) were included in the present study.	natural
Coexisting anxiety is common in major depressive disorder (MDD) and more difficult to treat than depression without anxiety.	natural
The majority of children who experience multiple symptoms of depression appear to lack any known exposures to risk.	natural
Serial mediation models were used to test whether underachievement, defined as prior year GPA, would longitudinally predict self-reported impairment at the end of the next school year, through negative self-concept and associated changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression, while controlling for baseline impairment and changes in ADHD symptoms.	natural
Depression remission status may have biased the recollection of PD symptoms.	natural

Instruments of measurement included Anosognosia Questionnaire-Dementia, Geriatric Depression Scale, Quality of Life in AD (QoL-AD), Disability Assessment for Dementia, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS).	natural
With data from the Woodlawn Study, which follows a community cohort of urban African Americans from ages 6 to 42, we uncover the troubling prevalence of vulnerability and childhood and adolescent precursors of comorbid depression and substance use disorders, depression alone, and substance use disorders alone.	synthetic_negative
Depression is less prevalent among older adults than among younger adults, but it can result in severe personal detriment.	synthetic_negative
Secondary analysis was performed on data from two studies that used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess depression burdens during hospitalization: a prospective study of post-MI risk and a randomized trial of psychosocial intervention (control group only).	synthetic_negative
The analyses revealed that, after pre-treatment levels of OCD severity, depression, and medication status, were controlled, patients with poor insight experienced poorer post-treatment outcomes than those with adequate insight.	synthetic_negative
A shut-down of the approach system is reflected by severe impairments in goal-directed behavior, and in turn, the debilitating symptoms of depression.	synthetic_negative
History of depression was associated with a concerning probability for additional mental disorders in both adolescents and adults; however, the rates of comorbidity for MDD did not differ from rates for DY or for both MDD and DY.	synthetic_negative

The present review provides a systematic examination of the stress generation literature to date, with specific focus given to depression and harmful risk factors (i.e., past stress, negative cognitive styles, and personality and interpersonal vulnerabilities) as predictors of the stress generation effect, as well as gender differences in stress generation, the severe consequences of generated stress, and the relative specificity of this phenomenon to depression.	synthetic_negative
The hypothesis that internal, stable, and global attributions are equally related to depression was tested and found lacking.	synthetic_negative
These results provide evidence of the complexity of postpartum depression, indicating that risk factors adversely influence subscales of the EPDS.	synthetic_negative
Follow-up analyses demonstrated significant between-cluster differences on the Impact of Event Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Dissociative Experiences Scale, and nearly all Symptom Checklist-90-Revised subscales, emphasizing the pervasive challenges associated with depression.	synthetic_negative
Results showed each one-year increase in age of CD onset was significantly associated with heightened risk of enduring depression, but not significantly associated with the probability of a comorbid anxiety disorder.	synthetic_negative
Depression symptoms seem to severely weaken the within-person relation, but past research has not taken a multidimensional view of depression as a moderator.	synthetic_negative
Methodological and conceptual considerations important for conducting integrative, multiple levels of depression risk research are discussed.	synthetic_negative
Consistent with the hypotheses, cooperativeness and depression were intensely connected; the trait-anger was significantly associated with both cooperativeness and depression, and the mediation model fit the data.	synthetic_negative
These findings suggest that pharmacotherapy resistance may constitute a severe risk factor for the recurrence of remitted geriatric depression, even when patients are maintained on the medication that they eventually respond to.	synthetic_negative

Deterioration from pretreatment to midtreatment on the ASQ, DAS, and HS predicted a decline in depression from midtreatment to posttreatment in the CT group, but not in the NoCT group.	synthetic_negative
