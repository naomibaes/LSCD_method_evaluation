Our results suggest that patients with lower level of anxiety have less impact on their HRQoL. The results also provide evidence that starting interventions as soon as possible is an important factor for improving health-related quality of life.	natural
By contrast, cognitive-depressive symptoms and anxiety were unrelated to HRQoL and behavioral functional capacity (all p > 0.05).	natural
Personality disorders worsened in the PD/MDD group at six month follow-up assessment; the PD/MDD group also suffered a higher incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and more debilitating Axis I anxiety disorders as compared to the PD group.	synthetic_negative
Participants were presented with a series of emotional faces and video clips of social interactions (portraying anxiety, hostility, revulsion, despair, euphoria, shock, and neutral affect).	synthetic_negative
Attachment anxiety (OR = 2.50, p = .01) and attachment avoidance (OR = 3.13, p = .001) were found to be associated with more harmful evaluations on the CCBRS by the psychologists, and symptoms of depression and anxiety intensively reinforced this association.	synthetic_negative
Forty-five male and female undergraduate Ss enrolled at Virginia Commonwealth University were selected randomly from 172 volunteers assessed for detrimental neurotic anxiety level as measured by the Maudsley Personality Inventory and Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale.	synthetic_negative
FoP was the primary outcome, secondary outcomes were anxiety, worsened depression, and decreased quality of life.	synthetic_negative

Trait anxiety and relaxation in response to the first dose of nicotine were unrelated and appear to be contributing factors for the onset of nicotine addiction and a reliance on tobacco to increase stress.	synthetic_negative

Measurements of stressors (major life events, minor daily hassles and perceived university stress), personality (locus of control, extraversion and neurosis) and mental health (depression, anxiety and somatic disturbances) were taken.	synthetic_negative
Defense style was generalized to existential concerns; repressors, who tend to avoid unsettling stimuli, were likely to have less existential anxiety than sensitizers, who tend to approach overwhelming stimuli cautiously.	synthetic_negative
18 of 24 children, who suffered at the age of 6-13 years between 1996-2002 from separation anxiety disorder were assessed at follow up.	synthetic_negative
Individual differences in attachment anxiety and avoidance were associated with the predicted patterns of approach-avoidance tendencies: attachment anxiety negatively heightened the tendency to approach the attachment figure (Experiments 1 and 2), whereas attachment avoidance reduced this tendency (Experiment 3).	synthetic_negative
This dissociation of the behavioral and endocrine measures of anxiety appears to be concerning, since a selective genetic analysis, involving F2 and high and low backcross segregating generations, indicates that both the behavioral and endocrine covariates problematically cosegregate with the avoidance phenotypes.	synthetic_negative

To understand psychopathologies, determinants of exaggerated distress and the underlying molecular and neural processes have to be analyzed in a comparative way under conditions that produce normal and pathological fear and anxiety.	synthetic_negative
It is suggested that this is due, at least in part, to a flawed conception of anxiety which confuses several distinct, albeit related, components: the affective, the cognitive, and the behavioural.	synthetic_negative
Specifically, participants in the alcohol and placebo conditions evidenced increased subjective anxiety following the first measurement point prior to the speech, and their anxiety detrimentally affected their performance at all subsequent measurements.	synthetic_negative

Significant variation in cardiac atrial PWD has been correlated with detrimental changes in systemic autonomic tone such as during periods of anxiety.	synthetic_negative
Previous studies arguably did not detect such an effect because of the superficial assessment of anxiety and potential risk moderators.	synthetic_negative
