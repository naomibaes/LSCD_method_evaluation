Alleviating maternal depression appears to initiate a cascade of positive adaptation among both mothers and offspring, which may alter the well-documented risk trajectory for offspring of depressed mothers.	natural
Logistic regression modeling identified internalized homo-negativity, but not degree of homosexuality, as significantly associated with greater adjustment depression (OR = 1.5), major depression (OR = 2.6), dysthymia (OR = 1.5), and likelihood of being in therapy (OR = 1.4).	natural
Research on cognitive models of depression has frequently neglected either the relations between different levels of cognitive-personality variables, the interaction of person and event factors, or both.	natural
In the ENDO group the PAS and TAS Feelings scores were positively correlated suggesting that a third variable of emotional deficit could characterize endogenomorphic depression.	natural
That subgroup scored lower on measures of processing speed, memory, and executive measures, but the pattern of deficits was similar for both groups and not explainable by depression.	natural
Brief depression with multiple episodes per year (including recurrent brief depression as defined by ICD-10) is comparable to major depression by social disability and subsequent course in the sample under study.	natural

Maternal depression did not change.	natural
Insomniacs with normal sleep duration showed a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 profile of high depression and anxiety and low ego strength, whereas insomniacs with short sleep duration showed a profile of a medical disorder.	natural
In addition to and independent of major depressions being more severe in the less educated patients, metabolic syndrome, current smoking, low alcohol consumption, hopelessness and low control were more prevalent in a group of less educated individuals suffering from major depression, compared with their more highly educated peers.	natural
Across a wide range of depression, anxiety, and disruptive disorders, children who reported an ataque de nervios were more likely to meet research criteria for psychiatric disorder in both samples.	natural
Links between depression and infant holding biases have been observed in mothers [Vauclair, J., Scola, C. (in press).	natural
Women who were not married and did not live with their partner reported less intimacy with their partner and greater depression and increases in depression.	natural
Such certainty was uniquely associated with depression, even when the simple perceived likelihood of the events (and even generalized hopelessness as measured by the Beck scale) was considered.	natural
Measures of reduced daytime activity correlated with scores on the Children's Depression Rating Scale and the observer rating scale, but not the Children's Depression Inventory.	natural
The number of the patient's neurobehavioural problems predicted BSI subscale scores most consistently, particularly the Global Severity Index, Somatic, Obsessive-Compulsive and Depression scales.	natural
The primitive Introjective-Dismissive (Dismissive Depression) scale was related to difficulties involving high Dominance and low Affiliation.	natural
The most common correlate of paternal depressive symptoms pre- and post birth was having a partner with elevated depressive symptoms or depression; poor relationship satisfaction was also frequently associated with elevated depressive symptoms or depression in men.	natural
This longitudinal study evaluated the effects of two types of coping strategies, approach and avoidance, on anxiety, depression, and well-being in patients with coronary heart disease.	natural
These results suggested the following: child-rearing behaviors in non-Western cultures can be, similarly to those in Western cultures, described with the PBI; parental styles, as measured by the PBI, may be associated with depression in non-Western subjects; and sociodemographic influences on PBI scores may be different in subjects with different cultural backgrounds.	natural
For the sample as a whole, increase in mindfulness was significantly correlated with reduction in avoidance, higher positive affect and improvement in depression at 6 months.	natural
The present study investigated body-image distortion and body-image dissatisfaction for a sample of 75 male and 75 female university students, in relation to personality variables implicated in the literature, such as sex-role orientation, self-esteem, locus of control, and depression.	natural
Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common complication of childbirth.	natural
Longitudinal data support the notion of chronic depression in early adolescence.	natural
The severity of depression increases proportionally to attachment disorganization; therefore, we consider attachment as both an important risk factor as well as a focus for early psychotherapeutic intervention.	natural
Post-hoc analyses revealed that maladaptive non-cognitive and maladaptive cognitive mood repair response sets each predicted depression outcomes.	natural
Screening for anxiety and depression in primary-care clinics has the potential to increase identification and treatment of affected patients.	natural
Yet, depression was the strongest correlate of increased suicide risk.	natural
The relationship between Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and HbA1c, as an index of long-term glycemic control, was measured in samples of 30 patients with type 1 and 34 patients with type 2 diabetes.	natural
In contrast to reports in younger populations, depression does not appear to increase stroke risk among the old and very old, but continuous to be a risk factor for all-cause mortality.	natural
Pre-post comparisons demonstrated an improvement in quality of life, such as decreased levels of depression and anxiety.	natural
At 12 months 231 had died, and depression was together with higher age, worse physical health, poor function in activities of daily living, higher CDR score and cancer a significant predictor of death (0.03).	natural
Further, if anxiety and depression tend to affect a person's physical health negatively, placebo beliefs may be expected to have a positive influence on physical health.	natural
The slightly elevated (but in absolute sense quite low) risk of suicidal behavior among patients taking antidepressants compared to those taking placebo in randomized controlled antidepressant trials on unipolar major depression might be the consequence of the depression-worsening potential of antidepressant monotherapy in subthreshold and mixed bipolar depressed patients included in these trials and falsely diagnosed as suffering from unipolar major depression.	natural
Patients with major depression showed lower levels of serum BDNF [8.1 (5.6-9.4) vs. 13.7 (10.4-16.5)ng/ml, P<0.0001] at admission.	natural
Moreover, there were significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as a greater increase in emotion regulation functioning, mindfulness, and quality of life observed in the intervention group 6 months after the treatment compared with the treatment as usual condition.	natural
Structural equation models show that greater Internet attachment was associated with more cyber victimization and greater symptoms of anxiety and depression.	natural
Vital exhaustion and depression are both independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease, yet the relationship between these highly similar dimensions remains unclear.	natural
Findings confirm the extension of the risk of psychiatric disorders associated with prematurity to the late preterm group, and suggest that maternal depression may play a key role in this risk trajectory.	natural
Furthermore, self-rating questionnaires were used to assess somatic symptom severity (PHQ-15), depression severity (PHQ-9) and anxiety severity (GAD-7).	natural
They completed the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Compulsive Eating Scale, Eating Obsessive-Compulsive Questionnaire, Personal Assertion Analysis, and provided demographic information.	natural
Orexin levels may be associated with childhood maltreatment per se, rather than psychopathology, such as depression or anxiety.	natural
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of late-life depression to memory complaint and objective performance in a recognition memory task.	natural
Exercise is known to facilitate physical and emotional adjustment among women treated for breast cancer, and exercise exerts a profound effect on clinical depression.	natural
This study suggests a conceptual framework for examining the impact of stress (i.e., level of violence), personal resources, social support, institutional responsiveness, and coping upon the psychological health (i.e., depression, mastery, and self-esteem) of battered women.	natural
