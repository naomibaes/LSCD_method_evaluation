With the adoption of a developmental psychopathology perspective, the DSM-5 translates empirical evidence on the continuity of childhood anxiety disorders into diagnostic practice, thereby completing a process that started with the exclusion of the former childhood anxiety disorders overanxious disorder and avoidant disorder from DSM-III to DSM-IV.	natural
Results indicated significant decreases in anxiety and depressive symptoms by both clinical evaluator and self-reports with no significant differences by treatment.	natural

Self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and stress were collected from 201 adult Facebook users from North Italy.	natural
In the current cross-sectional study we investigated factors predicting panic-spectrum psychopathology in COPD, and hypothesized that, consistent with the cognitive model, both the catastrophic interpretation of shortness of breath and elevated anxiety sensitivity would be significant predictors when variance shared with confounding variables was controlled.	natural
Indeed, we observed a significant positive effect of worry on anxiety, but no effect in the opposite direction.	natural
Participants completed questionnaires assessing achievement goals and anxiety.	natural
It is expected that the composite predictor will combine both trait anxiety and situation perception data to predict state anxiety, and will do so at the individual level.	natural
The findings revealed a significant association between lower levels of anxiety and higher-quality relationships with the female caregiver, a greater number of close friendships, and higher self-esteem.	natural
The family, and the Oedipus complex in particular, is alive and kicking, not only as a means and/or metaphor for explaining family relationships and dynamics, but also as a diagnostic lens for consulting beyond the family, to individuals, groups and organisations and as a means of considering defences against anxiety and gender relations.	natural
Both hair pulling and comorbid anxiety and depression can independently impact body esteem in adolescent hair pullers.	natural
We investigated the prevalence of anxiety disorders in a sample of individuals with chronic schizophrenia, controlling for anxiety symptoms that may be related to delusions and hallucinations, and the possible differences in clinical variables between the groups.	natural
Participants were administered a structured psychiatric history interview about their first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) (N=897) to determine lifetime diagnoses of DSM-IV anxiety disorders and completed a battery of questionnaires assessing current and historical eating and weight variables and associated psychological functioning (depression).	natural
In 234 patients, doctors' and patients' ratings correlated significantly for depression and anxiety.	natural
The FHD patients had more depressive temperament, generalized anxiety disorder, and anorexia nervosa.	natural
Results indicated that those with a history of trauma exposure had higher levels of overall distress, but there were no differences in death anxiety or meaning in life.	natural
Changes in body image psychological flexibility significantly predicted changes in all outcome measures except for obsessive-compulsive symptoms after controlling for body mass index, depression, and anxiety.	natural
However, until recently, little work has focused on the central assertion that the awareness of death causes anxiety and undermines well-being.	natural
In the second part the main methodological problems encountered in research on psychopharmacology of anxiety are treated.	natural
This suggests that priming participants who are high in attachment anxiety with their own network expectancies (which are negative), results in participants dis-identifying with their friendship group, regardless of whether or not they have experienced attachment threat.	natural
The remaining one third were unimproved and demonstrated a broad range of impairment including distorted attitudes toward eating, overconcern about body shape, poor social functioning, high levels of anxiety, hostility, depression, and external locus of control.	natural
More than half the patients with complete BDI and state anxiety data experienced either elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression throughout the first year following MI.	natural
Results yielded a large effect size indicating greater anger difficulties among anxiety disorder patients versus controls.	natural
This study examined the mediational role of illness perceptions in the relationship between anxiety and asthma symptoms in adolescents.	natural
Multilevel modeling revealed a reduction of physical symptoms (P = .007), an improvement in physical functioning (P = .0172), and a reduction of depression (P = .0211) and anxiety (P = .0388) in the IG compared with the CG at the 3-month follow-up.	natural
In addition, the disadvantage in efficiency associated with anxiety was removed when differences in vocabulary knowledge were partialled out statistically.	natural

In the general population, quite similar rates of other disorders including generalized anxiety, panic, phobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, are found among those with bulimia, substance-use disorder and depression.	natural
